Saturday 13th of December, the band will take the stage at Auckland’s glorious Hollywood Avondale for an all-ages show, playing Meow in Wellington on Sunday 14th December. After bursting onto the scene with two incredible albums in a single year - the brilliant Tracey Denim and the noisy niceness of The Twits - bar italia spent the next while earning a reputation as one of the best live bands in the game, including a sold out and sweaty show at Auckland’s Neck of the Woods. Since then, the band have been plotting their next move in world domination, dropping fan favourite single Cowbella in June, and this week lifting the lid on Some Like It Hot with accompanying tune Fundraiser - with a video featuring Matt “Super Hans” King. The London based band, built around the core of Nina Cristante, Jezmi Tarik Fehmi and Sam Fenton, may have looked to be hiding out this year while cooking up this new batch of tunes, but in reality they’ve been anything but dormant. Cristante teamed up with Yves Tumor for a dangerously good duet on We Don’t Count, while Jezmi and Sam dropped another full-length album under their Double Virgo moniker just last month.

After coming to fame via Drake’s “Chicago Freestyle,” the CA native became a force in his own right. Givēon had a whirlwind 2020 after releasing his Platinum-certified “Like I Want You” (225 million cross-platform streams in the US). He kept the momentum with “Heartbreak Anniversary,” a gauzy ballad that peaked at #16 on the Billboard Hot 100, garnered over 668 million streams, and earned 2X Platinum status. In March 2020, Givēon’s debut EP, Take Time, confirmed his evocative songwriting prowess and would be nominated for Best R&B Album at the 2021 Grammys. His fall When It’s All Said and Done EP further explored the peaks and valleys of love and, when re-packaged with its predecessor in 2021, hit #5 on the Billboard 200. After being nominated for a 2020 NAACP Image Award for Outstanding New Artist, he won BET’s 2021 Best New Artist, and his audience is growing—to the tune of over 1.7 billion streams globally. He even hit #1 on the Hot 100 in March on Justin Bieber’s “Peaches.” That hit helped him win award for Best Pop Song at the 2021 MTV VMA‘s where he was nominated for seven awards including Best New Artist, Best R&B and Best Pop Song. Drake then invited Givēon back into his world, this time for a sizzling verse on Certified Lover Boy’s “In the Bible” with Lil Durk—one of a guaranteed run of thrilling collabs to come.

Meet the surprising and spectacular creatures that call this place home, from tohorā (whales) to honu (turtles), and explore how this ecosystem now faces new threats. Te Moana-nui-a-Toi, an area largely unknown and rarely visited by most Aucklanders, comes alive through storytelling, ocean science, mātauranga Māori, contemporary art, and the voices of tangata whenua (Ngāti Rehua Ngātiwai ki Aotea). The exhibition reveals how both the giants and the smallest creatures play vital roles in maintaining the balance of this thriving marine world. Each year, these species gather in abundance during the seasonal upwelling of food-rich waters, a natural rhythm that has sustained life here for thousands of years. Today, that lifeforce is under pressure from climate change and human activity. Through interactives, compelling stories, and voices grounded in whakapapa, invites you to deepen your connection to the moana and feel inspired to help protect this extraordinary place. This exhibition is presented in partnership with Ngāti Rehua Ngātiwai ki Aotea, the mana whenua (customary guardians) of Aotea Great Barrier Island, whose whakapapa (ancestry) traces back to Toi, and whose people welcomed Kupe into Rangitāwhiri (Tryphena Harbour).

She’s worked her way up from a working-class background to being a top criminal defence barrister at the top of her game: prosecuting, cross-examining and winning in the courtroom with her quick wit and intelligence. She fights to defend those pleading not guilty – including securing freedom for men accused of rape and sexual assault. Innocent until proven guilty is, after all, the bedrock of human rights. An unexpected event forces Tessa to confront the very system she has spent her life believing in and working within. This is a system where the lines of patriarchal power and burden of proof are not set up to accommodate the lived experience of sexual assault survivors. Acclaimed Olivier and Tony award-winning play, Suzie Miller’s Prima Facie, is an unforgettable story and one-woman tour de force. It is an interrogation of the legal system itself. It asks us whether there is room in that system for emotion and experience. Prima Facie was first produced by Griffin Theatre Company in May 2019 at the SBW Stables Theatre, followed by the award-winning 2022 West End premiere at the Harold Pinter Theatre, which then travelled to the Golden Theatre on Broadway in 2023. Directed by Kiwi acting royalty Michael Hurst and performed by Cassandra Woodhouse, NZ Theatre Company is honoured to bring Prima Facie to the stage. This one final Auckland performance continues the call to action that this story is demanding worldwide: “Somewhere. Sometime. Somehow. Something has to change.” “It’s sublime storytelling from a sublime storyteller, shaped by a theatre genius, and it’s for us. A gift without ego. ” — Lexie Matheson Te wāhi Te huarahi ki reira ASB Waterfront Theatre is a 17-minute walk from Waitematā&nbsp;Station and accessible by many bus routes, including the City Link route.", "dates": {"start": "2026-02-27", "end": null, "text": "27 Feb 2026"}, "price": "$30.00 - $80.00", "location": "ASB Waterfront Theatre", "categories": ["Performing Arts", "Theatre", "Performing Arts", "Theatre", "Performing Arts", "Theatre", "Performing Arts", "Musical Theatre", "Performing Arts", "Musical Theatre", "Performing Arts", "Comedy", "Stay", "Hotel", "Stay", "Apartments", "Stay", "Apartments", "Stay", "Hotel", "Stay", "Hotel", "Stay", "Hotel", "Eat & Drink", "Bars, Restaurants", "Eat & Drink", "Restaurants", "Eat & Drink", "Restaurants", "Eat & Drink", "Cafes", "Eat & Drink", "Restaurants", "Eat & Drink", "Restaurants", "See & Do", "Leisure & Entertainment", "See & Do", "Cycling & Biking, Nature & Wildlife, Water sports & activities", "See & Do", "Cycling & Biking", "See & Do", "Spa & Wellness", "See & Do", "Water sports & activities", "See & Do"], "image": "https://www.aucklandnz.com/media/media/tau/tau_media/events/2146667-916018.png?ext=.png&crop=499,0,1873,1365", "updated_at": "2025-12-02T03:53:57Z"}
