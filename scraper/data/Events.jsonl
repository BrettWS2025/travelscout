Ruapuna Motorsport Park, Christchurch As Australasia’s premier touring car series, Supercars promises high-octane action, fierce competition and an unforgettable experience — and we can’t wait to see it all unfold right here in Christchurch in 2026. For the first time, drivers will battle it out on the iconic South Island circuit — led by Kiwi star Matt Payne, winner of the Jason Richards Memorial Trophy and now Bathurst 1000 champion. Fans from across Aotearoa can rally trackside to cheer on their 'King of the Mountain. ' Multiple transport options will be available to make getting to Ruapuna Raceway easy and hassle-free over the event weekend. . As Christchurch prepares to host Supercars, Ruapuna Raceway is undergoing targeted upgrades to meet track safety standards for its inaugural year. Led by the Canterbury Car Club and supported by Christchurch City Council, ChristchurchNZ, and Supercars, the immediate focus is on ensuring the circuit complies with all safety requirements for drivers and spectators. Infrastructure enhancements will continue in subsequent years, building on this foundation to elevate the venue into a world-class motorsport destination. An accessible viewing area will be located between turn 10 and turn 11, near gate B. Please purchase a Trackside General Admission ticket and email to advise your requirements. The venue is a mix of sealed roads, dirt roads and grass. Viewing areas around the track are all raised above the racetrack, and therefore, there is a requirement to navigate inclines and descents around the venue. Corporate tickets can be purchased for the Engine Room, which caters to those using a wheelchair. There are also a number of wheelchair-friendly toilets in the precinct. Accessible parking will be located in the premium carpark. There are limited carparks in this location, which will be on a first-come, first-served basis. Spectators parking here will need to show a valid ticket to the event (including all passengers in the vehicle) and a valid NZ mobility parking permit clearly displayed on the front windscreen of the vehicle. Entry to this carpark for valid mobility car parking permits is free.
