IGGY POP Considered by many the ‘Godfather of Punk’ IGGY POP is widely acknowledged as one of THE most dynamic stage performers of all time. He has built a legendary career filled with both critical acclaim and fanatic cult success. This year alone Iggy has performed numerous festival and headline dates across Europe followed by a recent North American tour, he has also just been confirmed for 2026’s Coachella Music Festival. A fearless and legendary rock front man known for his outrageous, unpredictable and physically demanding stage performance, Iggy’s recent set lists have focused on his classic material with songs like ‘T.V. Eye’, ‘Raw Power’, ‘The Passenger’, ‘Lust for Life’ and fan favourite, ‘Real Wild Child’ as well as showcasing songs from his 2023 album ‘Every Loser’. JOAN JETT AND THE BLACKHEARTS JOAN JETT grew up during a time when Rock ‘n’ Roll was off limits to girls and women, but as a teenager, she promptly blew the door to the boy’s club right off its hinges. After forming her band with the Blackhearts in 1979, she has had eight platinum and gold albums and nine Top 40 singles, including the classics ‘Bad Reputation’, ‘I Love Rock ‘n’ Roll’, ‘I Hate Myself For Loving You’, and ‘Crimson and Clover’. Described as the “Queen of Rock ‘n’ Roll” and “Godmother of Punk”, Joan Jett is celebrated for her rebellious spirit, fierce performances, and raw powerful music. Jett along with her band The Blackhearts will be coming to Aotearoa in 2026. ZED ZED were an essential part of the soundtrack to New Zealand life between 1999 and 2004, amassing an impressive ten Top 40 hits during the height of their career. The band — still performing with their original line-up — has matured into a powerhouse live act. Fans can expect timeless favourites like ‘Renegade Fighter’, ‘Hard to Find Her’, and ‘Glorafilia’, alongside fresh new material that reaffirms their place as one of New Zealand’s most enduring rock bands Location Te wāhi Spark Arena View venue Plan your route Plan your transport Local tip He tīwhiri mō te rohe Taxis and rideshares can be hard to come by directly after an event.

It’s simply, local households decorating their homes for the joy of it. Every fairy light, inflatable reindeer, twinkling star, and quirky Christmas scene is dreamed up and created by the people who live right here. It’s a community tradition that’s been lovingly built, house by house, for more than 30 years. “We do it because seeing kids’ faces light up is the best gift we could ask for.” Once again, a huge shout-out goes to our amazing local Ponsonby businesses, who have chipped in to help light up some of our iconic Franklin Road trees. Their support means even more sparkle overhead as you wander down the street and with Ponsonby Road just around the corner, it’s easy to top off the night with a cocktail, dinner, or a sweet treat. Do note that on Wednesday 17 December & Thursday 18 December, there will be a spectacular Christmas Light Show at Te Rimutahi (254 Ponsonby Road) from 8.30pm – 10.30pm. To help keep the magic merry and bright, we ask visitors to: Walk the street if you can — it’s simply the best way to see the lights. Think about public transport or rideshare to avoid the Grinchy part (traffic!) Have a little thought for the residents who start tucking themselves up in bed after 10pm.

Days drift from beach swims to dance-floor joy, kids darting between artworks, and friends sharing delicious kai under the trees. As evening arrives, stages glow, costumes shimmer and strangers feel like whānau. It’s playful, warm and genuinely welcoming, a place to rest or rave, reflect or be ridiculous. Salt on your skin, music in your chest, stars overhead. Life at its brightest. Alongside the music sits a generous programme of performance, arts, ceremony and wellbeing. You’ll find dancers, circus artists and storytellers moving through the park, while workshops offer movement, meditation and craft. The whenua shapes the festival. Splore works with Ngāti Whanaunga and Ngāti Pāoa to honour Tāpapakanga, uplifting mātauranga Māori and welcoming guests with care and connection. Pōwhiri opens the gathering and the stories of this place guide the experience. Culture sits at the heart of the celebration, held with respect. Splore also leads with sustainability. Its zero-waste approach, thoughtful design and long-term environmental kaupapa are recognised here and overseas. Everyone plays their part, helping protect the land, waters and wildlife that make Tāpapakanga so special. Come with curiosity. Be open. Be part of it.

Brimful of song, humour, love, and lashings of festive joy, A Christmas Carol is a magical, grand-in-scale production – perfect for the entire family . It’s Christmas Eve, and Ebenezer Scrooge is counting down the seconds until the silliness of the season passes. Deeply entrenched in his own misery, Scrooge receives a visit from four ghosts who whisk him away on a journey through Christmases past, present and future. Here, he revisits fragments of his life and is faced with a number of choices. Redemption is his for the taking – but is Old Scrooge capable of changing his ways before it’s too late? The Shake & Stir Theatre Co adaptation of A Christmas Carol has become a much-anticipated annual tradition in Brisbane. Since its premiere in 2018, this heart-warming story has captivated the hearts of over 127,000 people over seven return seasons. Shake & Stir Theatre Co’s Artistic Director, Ross Balbuziente says: “its sentiment resonates more profoundly than ever, reminding us of the enduring themes of love, forgiveness, and generosity that make the holiday season truly magical.” Complete with live music , yule-tide carolling , innovative video design , lavish costumes and, of course, snow , A Christmas Carol , is quite simply “the most uplifting theatrical experience you’ll have this year” (The Courier-Mail).

In Aotearoa, Laneway Festival Tāmaki Makaurau will take place on Thursday 5 February at Western Springs, shifting to the day before Waitangi Day for the very first time. That means fans can start their long weekend at Laneway, kicking things off with some of the most exciting new music from around the world before the tour heads across the Tasman to five Australian cities. Laneway Festival co-founders Danny Rogers and Jerome Borazio say, “It’s incredible to be celebrating 21 years of Laneway. What began as a little street party in a Melbourne laneway has grown into a summer ritual across Australia and New Zealand. Auckland has been such an important part of that story, and every year we’re blown away by the response from the artists, fans and community that make Laneway so special — 2026 is about honouring that history while looking to the future.” Proudly part of Auckland Council Whānau Location Te wāhi Western Springs Stadium View venue Plan your route Plan your transport Local tip He tīwhiri mō te rohe Being an outdoor venue, it pays to pack a layer (or two) and check the forecast for signs of wet weather ahead.

Following the 75-minute screening, Tekinati will take part in a Q&A, sharing insights into the making of the film and the realities facing Kiribati. About the film OCEANIA begins at the centre of the planet on a coral atoll – predicted to become uninhabitable by 2030 due to rising sea levels and temperatures brought by climate change. We journey with a mother and her adult son as they struggle to maintain their culture, freedom and independence. In the wake of decades of colonising encounters, we soon realise our seemingly disparate histories, experiences and fates — are all connected. Oceania is a lyrical documentary that explores climate change over 8 years through the eyes of two characters in the remote Pacific island nation of Kiribati. Tekinati is deeply grounded in her indigenous culture and environment, despite generations of Western depredation. Now, as the climate changes, her adult son Charles tries to find a path into his future which becomes increasingly disrupted. Some Western environmentalists have viewed Kiribati and other Pacific nations simply as a canary in climate change’s cage – their destruction proof of a climate emergency. In Oceania, we are offered counter-narratives that examine deeper geopolitical histories of colonisation and the impact this continues to have on the I-Kiribati people and possible solutions for their future. About Tekinati Ruta Co-Writer/Creative Producer (Republic of Kiribati) Tekinati Ruka is a native of Kiribati with extensive knowledge of the island’s shifting landscape as well as indigenous cultural traditions. She teaches workshops across the 33 islands on traditional lifeways including planting/growing techniques in high heat/low rain conditions. She is a singer and storyteller within her village community and a main subject within the story of OCEANIA.

The exhibition reveals how both the giants and the smallest creatures play vital roles in maintaining the balance of this thriving marine world. Each year, these species gather in abundance during the seasonal upwelling of food-rich waters, a natural rhythm that has sustained life here for thousands of years. Today, that lifeforce is under pressure from climate change and human activity. Through interactives, compelling stories, and voices grounded in whakapapa, Ngā Huhua: Abundance invites you to deepen your connection to the moana and feel inspired to help protect this extraordinary place. This exhibition is presented in partnership with Ngāti Rehua Ngātiwai ki Aotea, the mana whenua (customary guardians) of Aotea Great Barrier Island, whose whakapapa (ancestry) traces back to Toi, and whose people welcomed Kupe into Rangitāwhiri (Tryphena Harbour).

Set in Tāmaki Makaurau, this fiercely funny drama follows Flo and Jo, an Afro-queer couple on the brink of parenthood. As they prepare to adopt a child, they invite Flo’s religious sister Marie for dinner. What should be a celebration erupts into an emotional collision of old wounds, cultural assumptions, and love tested across family lines. Chout’s script, rich with tenderness and wit, explores identity, immigration, and faith. Chout also stars as Flo, joined by Sonya Renee Taylor (Jo) and Sandra Zvenyika (Marie). Together, the trio bring remarkable depth and dynamism. Celebrated for its sharp comic timing and authenticity , Po’ Boys & Oysters is a vibrant portrait of chosen family, hard conversations, and the many ways love shows up at the table.
