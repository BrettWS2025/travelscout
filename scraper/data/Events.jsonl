She’s worked her way up from a working-class background to being a top criminal defence barrister at the top of her game: prosecuting, cross-examining and winning in the courtroom with her quick wit and intelligence. She fights to defend those pleading not guilty – including securing freedom for men accused of rape and sexual assault. Innocent until proven guilty is, after all, the bedrock of human rights. An unexpected event forces Tessa to confront the very system she has spent her life believing in and working within. This is a system where the lines of patriarchal power and burden of proof are not set up to accommodate the lived experience of sexual assault survivors. Acclaimed Olivier and Tony award-winning play, Suzie Miller’s Prima Facie, is an unforgettable story and one-woman tour de force. It is an interrogation of the legal system itself. It asks us whether there is room in that system for emotion and experience. Prima Facie was first produced by Griffin Theatre Company in May 2019 at the SBW Stables Theatre, followed by the award-winning 2022 West End premiere at the Harold Pinter Theatre, which then travelled to the Golden Theatre on Broadway in 2023. Directed by Kiwi acting royalty Michael Hurst and performed by Cassandra Woodhouse, NZ Theatre Company is honoured to bring Prima Facie to the stage. This one final Auckland performance continues the call to action that this story is demanding worldwide: “Somewhere. Sometime. Somehow.

Saturday 13th of December, the band will take the stage at Auckland’s glorious Hollywood Avondale for an all-ages show, playing Meow in Wellington on Sunday 14th December. After bursting onto the scene with two incredible albums in a single year - the brilliant Tracey Denim and the noisy niceness of The Twits - bar italia spent the next while earning a reputation as one of the best live bands in the game, including a sold out and sweaty show at Auckland’s Neck of the Woods. Since then, the band have been plotting their next move in world domination, dropping fan favourite single Cowbella in June, and this week lifting the lid on Some Like It Hot with accompanying tune Fundraiser - with a video featuring Matt “Super Hans” King. The London based band, built around the core of Nina Cristante, Jezmi Tarik Fehmi and Sam Fenton, may have looked to be hiding out this year while cooking up this new batch of tunes, but in reality they’ve been anything but dormant. Cristante teamed up with Yves Tumor for a dangerously good duet on We Don’t Count, while Jezmi and Sam dropped another full-length album under their Double Virgo moniker just last month. With the album dropping on Matador this October, local fans will have a couple of short months to learn the words and get ready to scream and swoon along when bar italia hit our shores this December.

Ruapuna Motorsport Park, Christchurch As Australasia’s premier touring car series, Supercars promises high-octane action, fierce competition and an unforgettable experience — and we can’t wait to see it all unfold right here in Christchurch in 2026. For the first time, drivers will battle it out on the iconic South Island circuit — led by Kiwi star Matt Payne, winner of the Jason Richards Memorial Trophy and now Bathurst 1000 champion. Fans from across Aotearoa can rally trackside to cheer on their 'King of the Mountain. ' Multiple transport options will be available to make getting to Ruapuna Raceway easy and hassle-free over the event weekend. . As Christchurch prepares to host Supercars, Ruapuna Raceway is undergoing targeted upgrades to meet track safety standards for its inaugural year. Led by the Canterbury Car Club and supported by Christchurch City Council, ChristchurchNZ, and Supercars, the immediate focus is on ensuring the circuit complies with all safety requirements for drivers and spectators. Infrastructure enhancements will continue in subsequent years, building on this foundation to elevate the venue into a world-class motorsport destination. An accessible viewing area will be located between turn 10 and turn 11, near gate B. Please purchase a Trackside General Admission ticket and email to advise your requirements. The venue is a mix of sealed roads, dirt roads and grass. Viewing areas around the track are all raised above the racetrack, and therefore, there is a requirement to navigate inclines and descents around the venue. Corporate tickets can be purchased for the Engine Room, which caters to those using a wheelchair. There are also a number of wheelchair-friendly toilets in the precinct. Accessible parking will be located in the premium carpark. There are limited carparks in this location, which will be on a first-come, first-served basis.
