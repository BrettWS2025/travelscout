Saturday 13th of December, the band will take the stage at Auckland’s glorious Hollywood Avondale for an all-ages show, playing Meow in Wellington on Sunday 14th December. After bursting onto the scene with two incredible albums in a single year - the brilliant Tracey Denim and the noisy niceness of The Twits - bar italia spent the next while earning a reputation as one of the best live bands in the game, including a sold out and sweaty show at Auckland’s Neck of the Woods. Since then, the band have been plotting their next move in world domination, dropping fan favourite single Cowbella in June, and this week lifting the lid on Some Like It Hot with accompanying tune Fundraiser - with a video featuring Matt “Super Hans” King. The London based band, built around the core of Nina Cristante, Jezmi Tarik Fehmi and Sam Fenton, may have looked to be hiding out this year while cooking up this new batch of tunes, but in reality they’ve been anything but dormant. Cristante teamed up with Yves Tumor for a dangerously good duet on We Don’t Count, while Jezmi and Sam dropped another full-length album under their Double Virgo moniker just last month. With the album dropping on Matador this October, local fans will have a couple of short months to learn the words and get ready to scream and swoon along when bar italia hit our shores this December.

View times Givēon has made himself one of music’s brightest stars by bringing vivid color, depth, and soul to songs that capture the intensity of life’s twists and turns. After coming to fame via Drake’s “Chicago Freestyle,” the CA native became a force in his own right. Givēon had a whirlwind 2020 after releasing his Platinum-certified “Like I Want You” (225 million cross-platform streams in the US). He kept the momentum with “Heartbreak Anniversary,” a gauzy ballad that peaked at #16 on the Billboard Hot 100, garnered over 668 million streams, and earned 2X Platinum status. In March 2020, Givēon’s debut EP, Take Time, confirmed his evocative songwriting prowess and would be nominated for Best R&B Album at the 2021 Grammys. His fall When It’s All Said and Done EP further explored the peaks and valleys of love and, when re-packaged with its predecessor in 2021, hit #5 on the Billboard 200. After being nominated for a 2020 NAACP Image Award for Outstanding New Artist, he won BET’s 2021 Best New Artist, and his audience is growing—to the tune of over 1.7 billion streams globally. He even hit #1 on the Hot 100 in March on Justin Bieber’s “Peaches.” That hit helped him win award for Best Pop Song at the 2021 MTV VMA‘s where he was nominated for seven awards including Best New Artist, Best R&B and Best Pop Song. Drake then invited Givēon back into his world, this time for a sizzling verse on Certified Lover Boy’s “In the Bible” with Lil Durk—one of a guaranteed run of thrilling collabs to come.
