Read more Meet our Queensland specialists See all See all Chelsea Rowe House of Travel Mount Maunganui Why a customer would choose me: I'm honestly in my dream job - I get to combine my passion for travel with my love of organisation and planning. Travel has changed so much over the last few years and continues to do so, which means there are more details to consider than ever before. It's so much fun getting to know my clients and helping them come up with the perfect itinerary. I can research to my heart's content and get into the nitty gritty to make sure your trip flows smoothly. You just bring me your dream and we can build it together. Then leave me to focus on the details, so that you can relax and have your best adventure yet! Meet Me: I moved home to NZ in 2017 after living on the Sunshine Coast in Australia for ten years during my 20's (yes, I'd love to help you plan your next trip over there). In the weekends I'm either reading a good book at home cuddled up with my rescue cats, or traipsing through the local forests - I'm not much of a city dweller if I can help it. When it comes to travel, my attitude leans more towards 'go big or go home'. If I'm flying halfway around the world, you can bet that I'm going to make the most of it. I will bargain hunt my heart out so that I can fit in more days, more locations and more fun. I mean, is there any better feeling in the world than standing somewhere you've never been before, experiencing new things, tasting new foods, meeting new people and just having the time of your life? Chelsea Nicky Aitken House of Travel Papamoa I have had a lifelong love affair for exploring the world. Raised in a family that prioritised travel, I inherited a passion for all things travel. I have lived in different countries (London, USA, Argentina) and I am fascinated with the rich tapestry of culture, people, religion and food in new places. My love for travel has taken me to some of the world’s most amazing places! From Mauritius to Bahamas and all in between, I have been privileged to experience the world and being able to speak and understand 5 languages English, Afrikaans, Dutch, German and Greek) certainly comes in helpful. I have grown up in South Africa, spending most of my adult life there, being able to show my clients what makes this region so unique is a privilege. Africa was my backyard after all and even after living in NZ for almost 12 years, my heart still beats to the African Drum. For me, choosing a favourite destination is impossible. But .. Bali has literally captivated my heart, and even though I have been there 20+ times, I still always find new things to uncover. As does the Maldives, Mauritius and Seychelles, these islands just have the “it” factor I also love ocean cruising, especially Mediterranean and the Caribbean. Cruising offers such a great variety and a chance to see multiple destinations and experiencing iconic landmarks and locations from your hotel on the sea. I WOULD SAY MY PASSION IS MAKING MY CLIENTS DREAM HOLIDAYS COME TRUE AND I PRIDE MYSELF ON MY EFFICIENT SERVICE AT ALL TIMES.

Years in the industry: 19+ No. of countries visited: 25 Favourite place to visit: Africa "Travel is the healthiest addiction" - Anonymous Why I love travel: For me life is about experiences, not things! I love exploring new places, cultures, environments. I see travel for me as an addiction - I just can't stay away and helping people is so rewarding. My travel tips: Travel as soon as you can, don't delay as life is too short. If you want an adventure head to Antarctica or the Arctic before anywhere else. Always carry a change of clothes, any valuables and medication in your carry-on luggage. The House of Travel online brochures are a great source of information when planning your journey then we can finetune your holiday for you. My top 5 destinations: Africa- Serengeti plains!!! Perfect place to go to create family memories with our young adult kids! Adventure to encounter wildlife and camping in the Serengeti! Dubai- the mix of culture, sights, architecture, markets, desert and the malls - even though shopping is not my thing. Denali National Park and Preserve in Alaska - I was incredibly fortunate to have a family holiday in Canada, Alaska, Las Vegas and California and I'll never forget rafting on the Nenana River, rounding a bend to see a moose and her two calves taking a drink …. we all forgot to keep paddling; it was an incredible sight! Rome - the history and the chaos of a bustling city it offers so much culture with a cool vibe. Thailand - I lived near Chiang Mai as an exchange student many years ago and have been back to the country three times. It is great for families, couples, singles with so much to see and do. What's in my suitcase? Happiness - I'm always in my happy place as soon as I travel. Active wear - Our holidays always include adventure and plenty of travel. A copy of my passport and insurance policy number and phone number, in case I lose my carryon bag and phone. Bridget Best. Holidays. Ever! Inspired to travel to Queensland?
