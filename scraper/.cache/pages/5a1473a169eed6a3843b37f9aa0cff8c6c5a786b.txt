Read more Meet our Queensland specialists See all See all Kelsey Mackay House of Travel Hamilton East My favourite thing about this job being able to explore and research lots of cool destinations daily and creating some cool itineraries is really exciting. I love hearing all about the trip and my client’s experiences when they get home but it’s certainly making my book-it “list” turn into a novel. My favourite place I have visited is Puerto Rico - from the beautiful white-sand beaches and the best coffee & chocolate I’ve ever had, this country is so rich with culture. It’s sure to be a memorable port stop on your next Caribbean Cruise. The next place I would love to explore is South America - from Argentina, along the Amazon from Rio, Brazil, Venezuela and Peru! Kelsey Hannah Brown House of Travel Wanaka Always with a smile I will be just as excited and passionate about your future adventures as you are! Originally from the UK I've spent the last 10 years travelling around the globe before finally settling in heavenly New Zealand. Here I've turned the joy of travel into a profession I love. I enjoy nature, the beach, spending time with loved ones and exploring new places especially on the open road or by cruise. I believe the biggest adventure you can take is to live the life of your dreams! To me, traveling is so much more than a simple trip or relaxing vacation; it is a journey that always leaves me transformed and forever changed by the experiences presented. I have had the pleasure of visiting too many countries to count from backpacking on a shoestring budget around Asia to going all out on a private luxury adventure filled holidays such as trekking Machu Pichu! My firsthand recommendations will ensure that your destination choices, no matter how uncommon, are always extraordinary. No matter what you are looking for, whether it’s a bucket list adventure or something that completely takes you off the grid, you can count on me to open doors to the most exceptional experiences and enhance every travel adventure. Hannah Mathew Quach House of Travel Lower Hutt I’m truly passionate about travel, whether it’s exploring new cultures, uncovering hidden gems, or helping others plan their perfect escape. I love researching destinations, creating unique trips, and capturing the journey through my photography. While I plan all kinds of holidays, I also have a soft spot for sports travel, there’s nothing like experiencing an F1 race or Football match live! Whether it’s a relaxing beach break or an adrenaline filled getaway, I bring energy, insight, and a personal touch to every trip. Let’s turn your travel ideas into unforgettable experiences. Mathew Danny Hooper House of Travel Johnsonville I have been in the travel Industry for 20 years and am convinced that it is the most exciting industry to be a part of. I still get excited about all things travel and love exploring new and exciting destinations or passing on the knowledge and ideas to customers to ensure they have the most amazing experience on holiday.
