My love for travel began early—at 19, I left New Zealand with a one-way ticket to London to start my OE, and I’ve never looked back. I spent eight years living overseas, including four incredible years in London, where I explored Europe extensively. (Barcelona still has my heart!) I began my travel career in Melbourne in 2004, and I knew I’d found my dream job. Even now, I still smile every day coming to work—I truly LOVE what I do. Helping clients plan their adventures brings me so much joy. I specialise in point-to-point Europe itineraries, and I’m especially passionate about tours and cruising. Whether it’s your first trip or your tenth, I’m here to make your journey smooth, exciting, and unforgettable from start to finish. I’m known for being friendly, bubbly, and a great listener. I’ll take the time to understand your needs and offer thoughtful advice and suggestions to make your trip the best it can be. Now based on a dairy farm in Reporoa with my husband and our three young children, I understand the #mumlife juggle—and the importance of taking time out for a well-earned holiday! Having travelled to over 40 countries, I can’t wait to share my experience with you. Sarah Angela Delany House of Travel Taupo Bula, Bonjour, Talofa, Konnichiwa – and welcome! From the moment I could dream, I dreamed of travel. At just 17, I set out on that path by diving into my first travel course, and I’ve never looked back. For the first decade, I poured my heart into everything South Pacific – those sparkling waters, warm smiles, and sun-soaked cultures became my world. Now, my map has expanded far beyond the Pacific, and I’m proud to say I sell the entire world. And what a breathtakingly vast world it is! Over the past 30 years, I’ve been incredibly fortunate to explore some of its most magical corners – Samoa, Bali, Vietnam, Hawaii, Italy, and Switzerland are just a few of the places that have left footprints on my soul. But this journey isn't just about me. It’s about you – your dreams, your adventures, your once-in-a-lifetime moments. I’m here to ignite your excitement, guide your decisions, and help piece together your perfect travel jigsaw. Whether you’re hopping over to Australia, meandering through the Scottish Highlands in a small group, or gliding past alpine peaks on a Swiss rail tour – I’ll be right beside you, making it all seamless. There’s nothing quite like nabbing that dream tour, then weaving in the best flights, stopovers, and secret gems to create an itinerary that’s more than a trip – it’s an experience. Over the years, I’ve learned something simple but powerful: every place is unique, kindness connects us all, and life’s most precious souvenirs are the memories we make. So let’s start building yours. Angela Deepti Mehta House of Travel Hobsonville As someone who loves to explore the world, I've been to many places and learned a lot along the way.
