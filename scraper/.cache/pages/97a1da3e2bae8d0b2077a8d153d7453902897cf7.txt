Day to Day itinerary Day 1 - Valletta The whole of the Maltese capital Valletta is UNESCO World Heritage listed and occupies a peninsula in the north-east of the island. From the fountain of Tritons to Saint-Elme fort, there are as many majestic streets as there are narrow staircase vennels to explore. The painted loggia and carved corbels on the tall houses will accompany you in your explorations, and you’ll rarely be bothered by traffic. You can visit the Grandmasters palace decorated with coats of arms and frescoes. Saint-John’s cathedral and the ramparts which have guarded the city since the 16th century are also among the most emblematic sites of the city. Arranged in terraces, the Barrakka Gardens will punctuate your promenade with a green and floral experience. Day 2 - Syracuse, Sicily Its undulating rocky coastline, the endless sandy beaches, the menacing form of Mount Etna which surveys its island like a patriarch, the flowery gardens on the hillside... Sicily lays out its varied landscapes like a shopkeeper displays his wares. Described by Cicero as “the most beautiful city in the world”, Syracuse was one of the most prestigious cities in Sicily and at her height was even a rival for Athens. A central city of Ancient Greece, it was home to a succession of civilisations, each of which has left their mark. The blend of Arabic, Roman, Norman, Byzantine and Spanish cultures makes Syracuse a town that is extraordinarily rich in fragrances, colours and flavours. Day 3 - Otranto Located in the Apulia region, Otrante is the easternmost transalpine town. Behind its medieval ramparts, you will taste the sweetlife of Salento, the “heel on Italy’s boot”. Inhabited since Antiquity, Otrante has today become a very pleasant seaside town. Yet its history is still visible as you meander through the little streets of its old centre. With its magnificent 12th century ornamental mosaic tiling, the Cathedral is one of its most beautiful treasures. During a stroll along the ramparts, you can sit and relax at a café terrace. Day 4 - Bari Extending out along a fertile plain facing the Adriatic Sea amid infinite landscapes sculpted by the water and wind, Bari bears the traces of the peoples which, over the centuries, have conquered it, settled it, or simply visited it fleetingly before making their way to faraway lands. Though its exact origins are lost among the mysteries of archaeology, the many sites here provide evidence of the town’s rich past. The Saracens, Byzantines, Normans and Swabians have left a trace here, each bringing their own cultural baggage. During your stop here, stroll along the minuscule streets in Bari Vecchia, the historic centre, where you will find small churches and monuments from bygone eras. Day 5 - Anacona Situated on the promontory of Monte Conero, Ancona, the capital of the Marche region, offers visitors all the charm of a typical Italian historical city. Founded by the Greeks in 390 BC and conquered by Julius Caesar in 49 BC, Ancona has a long history that was very much shaped by its harbour, a hub attracting different populations and cultures. When your ship calls here, take the time to discover the city’s many buildings, such as the cathedral dedicated to Judas Cyriacus and its façade made of white and pink marble, the Arch of Trajan, which is considered to be the port’s main embellishment, or the 15th century mansion where the painter Raphael was raised. Day 6 - Ravenna Linked to the Adriatic Sea by a canal, the city of Ravenna and its countless monuments offer you a rich journey back in time. Roman and Byzantine cultures intermingle here, and the fruits of this history adorn the interiors of the cityﾒs religious buildings: the abundance of classical mosaics is the most stunning witness to Ravennaﾒs glorious past. Eight UNESCO World Heritage listed Paleo-Christian sites punctuate your journey into the historic heart of the city. Still very lively despite the weight of its history, Ravenna has much to offer to visitors. Day 7 - 9 - Venice Proud and eternal, Venice has reigned on its lagoon ever since the 6th century. You may think you know this city before even setting foot here. You will inevitably fall in love with the charm of the innumerable treasures of the Serenissima: Saint Mark’s square, the basilica, Doges palace, the Grand Canal and the gondolas. Yet, secret Venice is also waiting for you to explore its little interlacing streets and canals, to ramble through its squares and to push open the doors of its churches. The city’s extraordinary heritage shouldn’t stop you from enjoying a glass of Spritz and a few tramezzini. Your Ship Le Bougainville, the third ship in the PONANT EXPLORERS series, combines elegant design, cutting-edge technology, and an open layout that keeps you connected to the sea. With an intimate size and state-of-the-art equipment, it offers a refined cruising experience to some of the world’s most inspiring destinations. A day on board begins with a delicious breakfast in your cabin or the restaurant, followed by expertly guided excursions ashore. Enjoy gourmet lunches and French-inspired dinners accompanied by live piano music. Between adventures, relax with spa treatments, fitness sessions, or engaging lectures. Evenings come alive with concerts, dance, and film screenings, making every day a perfect blend of discovery, comfort, and entertainment.
