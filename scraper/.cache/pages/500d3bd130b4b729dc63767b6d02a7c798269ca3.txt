Your guides will provide a brief introduction to the Murray River before you board the pontoon cruiser and begin a 25km cruise upstream though old growth redgum and red ochre-coloured cliffs that flank the river. Start familiarising with river country with keen eyes scanning the tree line for koalas, whistling kites, and waterbirds. You’ll be welcomed to your eco-houseboat accommodation where you’ll enjoy lunch and settle in before setting off on a cultural walk through river country. The evening is spent on the houseboat admiring the cliff colours at sunset from the top deck or in the spa before your guides prepare a dinner paired with local wines to complete the day. Day 2: Sunrise Experience, kayaking and Houseboat cruising, Regent Parrots Rise before the sun to hear the birdsong and walk a gentle slope to the rim of the Murray River valley for a spectacular sunrise. Watch the vibrant colours of the river come to life, and spot busy Rainbow Bee Eaters catching insects. After Breakfast, meet your canoe guide for a morning paddle through peaceful creeks and billabongs lined by mighty red gums, rafting up occasionally to drift and listen. Quiet paddling is a great way to spot a goanna on a tree or a spectacular sacred kingfisher. Arriving back at the houseboat, start a two-hour houseboat cruise upstream to Chowilla Creek. Relax and enjoy the view as lunch is prepared by your guides. After lunch explore on foot the forests and wetlands at your new location watching and listening carefully for noisy flights of Regent Parrots. Retire early after a long day capped off with local fare. Day 3: Outback Lakes and Migratory waterbirds After an early breakfast, set off on a driving tour of the great ephemeral lake system on the outer floodplain where spectacular birdwatching includes migratory waders that have travelled from the northern hemisphere, thousands of ducks, pied stilts, red-necked avocets, spoonbills and musk ducks. Expect to see blue-bonnets, emus and their chicks, and magnificent red kangaroos as we drive across country between the lakes. Return to find the houseboat in a new location opposite the spectacular Bunyip Reach Cliffs above lock 6. Day 4: Houseboat cruise through a river lock and farewell BBQ After breakfast and an optional stroll on the riverbank, cruise leisurely down river and transfer through lock 6 on the way to the final mooring and departure point. Celebrate your experience over a BBQ lunch on the top deck, before farewelling the river and returning to the Hotel Renmark. Transfers depart from the Hotel at 2pm.
