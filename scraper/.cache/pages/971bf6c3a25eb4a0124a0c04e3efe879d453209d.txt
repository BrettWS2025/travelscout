Hos geldin! Welcome to Turkey. Your adventure begins in Istanbul – the continent-straddling metropolis that the Greeks, Romans, Byzantines and Ottomans have all once called home – with a welcome meeting at 1 pm. After you’ve met your local leader and group, you’ll head out for a guided tour of the Old City. Visit the ancient hippodrome, the Blue Mosque, the Grand Bazaar and the Suleymaniye Cami. This evening, maybe join your fellow travellers for dinner and dig into an authentic Turkish kebab. Day 2 Canakkale. After breakfast, hit the road to Canakkale – a port city on the southern shore of the Dardanelles. On the way, you’ll stop for a guided tour of Gallipoli to learn about the significant events that took place here during WWI. Your guide will take you to ANZAC Cove and major memorial sites like Brighton Beach and the ANZAC Commemorative Site. Make sure your camera is charged – the views of the Dardanelles Strait and the Gallipoli Peninsula here are gorgeous. This evening, you’ll spend the night in Canakkale with free time to grab dinner and recharge for tomorrow’s adventures. Day 3 Troy - Sirince - Selcuk. This morning, drive to the ancient city of Troy. Explore the ruins with your leader, snap a photo with a replica Trojan Horse and learn about how this place has confounded historians and archaeologists for centuries. Then, continue to Selcuk which sits on the slopes of Ayasoluk Hill. Head out with your leader for an orientation walk, passing Isa Bey Mosque and the imposing Byzantine citadel of the Grand Fortress. Then, drive to the nearby village of Sirince to taste locally produced fruit wines. This authentic Greek Ottoman village seems to have been overlooked by modern development and the unique architecture makes for a great photo. When you return to Selcuk, you have a free night. Day 4 Ephesus/Overnight Train. This morning, take a private minivan to the ancient city of Ephesus – one of the world’s best-preserved Greco-Roman classical cities. Once the capital of Roman Asia Minor, Ephesus has a fascinating history that really comes alive with a local guide to show you around. Considering their age, the ruins are in incredible shape, and it’s not difficult to imagine them in their full glory over 2000 years ago with running water, public toilets, a medical institute and Roman baths. The Great Theatre is well-preserved and regularly hosts concerts, but the Library of Celsus is the most striking. Then, have lunch and maybe watch the local ladies make gozleme. You'll have some free time this evening before transferring to Izmir to board an overnight train to Konya. Day 5 Konya / Cappadocia. Wake up in Konya, a historic Turkish city closely linked with the whirling dervish sect of Islam developed by Rumi, a famous Sufi mystic in the 13th century. Visit the Mevlana Museum, maybe watching an optional whirling dervish dance, and stretch your legs in town before hitting the road to Cappadocia. Look out for the fairy chimneys, the hallmark of the region's otherworldly landscape, as you drive across the Anatolian plains and stop at an underground city used as a safe haven during wartimes. Arrive in the town of Urgup in the late afternoon in time for a sunset walk in the valley. Your accommodation tonight is a traditional cave hotel that overlooks the valley. Day 6 Cappadocia . This morning, take an optional hot air balloon flight over Cappadocia at sunrise. If you don’t fancy it, you’ll still have an amazing view of the skyline dotted with balloons from the ground. Later this morning, enjoy a scenic walk through the valleys with your leader, featuring fairy chimneys, deserted rock-cut homes and cave churches. In your free time today, maybe visit the UNESCO-listed Goreme Open Air Museum, a monastic complex composed of churches, rectories and dwellings cut into the cliff. This evening, you’ll be warmly welcomed into a local home where you'll share a special home-cooked dinner with the family. Day 7 Cappadocia To Istanbul . Say goodbye to Cappadocia and transfer to the airport for a flight back to Istanbul (expect to arrive between 1 pm and 4 pm). After checking in to your hotel, take an evening stroll to one of the city's trendiest neighbourhoods – a place where tool-selling tradesmen share space with cool cafes and galleries. For dinner, perhaps try a local street food favourite, balik ekmek (fish sandwich) and cleanse the palate with a baklava. Maybe check out a few bars with your group to say serefe (cheers) to your time in Turkey, or enjoy a farewell cay (Turkish tea) overlooking the Bosphorus. Day 8 Istanbul . Your Turkey adventure comes to an end after breakfast, and there are no activities planned. However, if you'd like to spend more time in Istanbul, we’re happy to arrange additional accommodation (subject to availability). What You'll Love about this Trip Uncover over 2000 years of history at the ruins of Ephesus. Wander the Library of Celsus, hear your voice echo in the Great Theatre and learn about the wealthy residents who lived in the Terrace Houses. Taste local fruit wines in one of Turkey’s best-preserved Greek Ottoman villages and share a home-cooked meal with a local family in Cappadocia. Stay a little differently – spend a night in a traditional cave hotel overlooking a valley in the heart of Cappadocia. Explore the back streets of Istanbul’s Old City with your leader. Uncover stories of iconic sites like the Blue Mosque and Suleymaniye Cami, find hidden hangouts and get insider tips on what to eat. Join a guided tour in Gallipoli to listen to tales of bravery and comradeship of the heroic soldiers who fought here in WWI.
