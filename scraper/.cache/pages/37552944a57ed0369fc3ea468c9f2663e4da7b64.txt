Hope you’re ready for 7 epic days of French food, culture and views. Our first rendezvous is in the City of Love (obvs). This evening, we'll grab a welcome dinner with the crew, before hopping onto our coach to discover Paris by night. Get ready to capture the view of the Eiffel Tower, the Arc de Triomphe AND the Louvre! Then we’ll set sail on a Seine River cruise to see the City of Love sparkle in all its glory at night. This is what love at first sight feels like! Day 2 - Paris Croissants, coffees, pastries and perfumes - feeling like a Parisian already? After a tour of the city's charming Patisseries, you'll have the chance to discover a French perfumery. Then, you’ve got free time to hit all the epic museums here (you’ll love The Louvre!), and hit a local foodie hotspot for dinner. Day 3 - Paris to Normandy Au revoir, Paris. Next stop? The historic region of Normandy. History nerds, it’s your time to shine. We’ll stop by for lunch in the quaint medieval town of Bayeux. Then you’ll visit the historic D-Day Landing Beaches &amp; all its memorials. A quick tour of the Omaha Beach Museum will fill you in on their significance. A short drive later, we’ll reach Caen - our home for the night. You’ve got plenty of restaurants to choose from for dinner tonight. Something tells us you’ll be eating a lot of apples here… Day 4 - Normandy to Orleans via Mont Saint Michel and Château de Chambord Morning, sleeping beauties. Today’s agenda is all about jaw-dropping views. So freshen up, feast on breakfast and hop on! Cameras at the ready! This beautiful island (topped with a charming Abbey) will have you swooning over its unique perfect silhouette. Come explore all the intricate streets before we head on to our next stop. We’ll drive through the Loire Valley that’s famous for its chateaus. Best part? You have the chance to visit THE most charming one out here - Château de Chambord! The sun’s about to set. Tummies are starting to grumble. Surprise! Dinner’s on us tonight. So fuel up before we head out again tonight to discover Orlean’s historical hotspots. Day 5 - Orleans to Reims via Champagne Region Adieu, Orleans. The home of elegant bubbles awaits us. Raise a toast, because today you have the chance to discover a historical Champagne house on a guided tour (and taste some of that fizzy goodness too, ofc!). When in France…right? Time to tick another delightful French city off our list. Welcome to Reims! After checking into our hotel for the night, we’ll head out to get oriented with the city’s sights (including the UNESCO World Heritage Site of the Cathedral of Notre-Dame of Reims). Day 6 - Reims to Paris via Château de Chantilly Oh, Reims - you’ve been a dream. But before we head back to Paris, we’ll stop by another chateau! You’ve got the option to frolic around the garden, or check out how the finger-licking tasty Chantilly cream is made in a local workshop. This is your final chance to live like French nobility. Nice to see you again, Paris. It’s our final night here, so there’s only one thing left to do - watch a Moulin Rouge show with a delicious dinner, ofc! Day 7 - Paris And after breakfast, it’s time to say goodbye to France. Don’t forget to exchange socials with your crew (no French exits here, please!). Who knows which shiny new destination is on the cards for the next time… More Deals Enquire *Terms and Conditions Offer subject to availability at time of booking.
