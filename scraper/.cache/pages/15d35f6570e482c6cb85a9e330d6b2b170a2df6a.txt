One of the most culturally rich cities on Earth, Tokyo is the kind of place where everyday is a new adventure, and where no two neighbourhoods are the same. Some are deeply connected to the past, all glowing lanterns and low-slung rustic buildings, whilst others only have eyes for the future. To say Tokyo is eclectic would be a disservice to a city that prides itself on having something for everyone. This evening meet up with your Travel Director and fellow travellers for your first taste of Japanese cuisine. Day 2 - Tokyo Sightseeing Tokyo’s got variety and today you’ll see just that. Start with sky-high views from the Tokyo Metropolitan Observatory, then take a breather at the peaceful Meiji Jingu Shrine. Wander through Asakusa, shop for traditional treats along Nakamise Street and visit the centuries-old Sensō-ji Temple. This afternoon, choose your own adventure: explore Japan’s art, armour and ancient treasures on a Choice Experience to the Tokyo National Museum, with bonus shopping time in Ameyoko and glitzy Ginza. Or join a foodie-favourite Choice Experience and master the art of takoyaki—Japan’s famous snack balls—before diving into a tasty spread of yakitori, ramen, edamame and unlimited soft drinks. Day 3 - Mt. Fuji and Hakone Sightseeing You may have seen glimpses of its snowcapped peaks but today's the day you get up close and personal when you visit Mt. Fuji, the highest volcano in Japan. Drive up to the Fuji Subaru Line 5th Station (weather permitting) and catch your breath as you take in the scenery from 2,300 metres above sea level. Enjoy spectacular views of the Fuji Five Lakes area below and some free time for lunch in the shadow of Mt. Fuji's iconic peak. Not done with incredible scenery just yet? Opt for a ride on the Komagatake Ropeway for equally impressive views of Lake Ashi, a crater-formed lake. On the drive back through Hakone, soak in the mountain landscapes and traditional buildings of this tranquil city getaway before returning to your hotel, where the evening is all yours to relax or explore the streets on your last night in Tokyo. Day 4 - Tokyo - Kyoto Board the bullet train this morning and speed towards the atmospheric city of Kyoto at a staggering 320 kilometres per hour. Known for geishas, gorgeous temples and traditional teahouses, Kyoto will undoubtedly charm you in an instant, then continue to impress on your sightseeing tour this afternoon. Starting off at the iconic Golden Pavilion of Kinkaku-ji, gaze in wonder at this gold leaf covered beauty that shines like a beacon above its reflecting pond. Heading on to the visually stunning Heian-jingu Shrine, discover the history of this Shinto masterpiece and visit the 25 metre high torii gate that is equally, if not more beautiful than the shine itself. From here it will be on to a traditional handicraft centre to browse the Japanese crafts, before finally arriving at your hotel. No doubt hungry from an action-packed day, dinner tonight will be at a local restaurant. Day 5 - Kyoto Free Day Waking up this morning, the day is free to explore your way, and beautiful Kyoto is a prospect that will surely fill you with excitement. Perhaps start your day surrounded by lush greenery at the Ginkaku-ji shrine, or head over to the Gion district in the hopes of catching a glimpse of a geisha. Think of yourself as something of a foodie? You're in the right place. Kyoto is a huge culinary destination where you can enjoy fresh sushi, steaming bowls of ramen or creamy matcha ice cream to your heart's content, most likely at the Nishiki Market. This morning we imagine that you'll find our optional visit to Nara hard to resist. Known as a place that specialises in the art of bokusho (ink making), you'll watch talented artisans create these beautiful masterpieces and even have a go yourself before heading on to Todaji Temple and Nara Park, an area taken over by hundreds of cute, free roaming deer. Keen to see a Kyoto icon? You could join our optional trip to the Fushimi Inari Shrine. It's instantly recognisable for its tunnel of thousands of orange vermilion torii gates stretching upwards through a thickly wooded mountain towards the shrine. Day 6 - Kyoto - Kurashiki - Hiroshima Leaving Kyoto behind your first stop today will be Kurashiki, where you'll meet up with a Local Guide for a sightseeing tour of the historic Bikan Quarter. With black-and-white warehouses converted into contemporary museums, old wooden houses and winding laneways, this area exudes a timeless elegance. You'll learn stories about the trading history of the district before heading on to Hiroshima, a place that needs little introduction and a city where peace and hope resound. Destroyed beyond recognition on the 6th August 1945 by the world's first atomic bomb attack, Hiroshima respectfully remembers its catastrophic past while looking to the future with optimism. It's a thriving cosmopolitan city with a lot to offer, including its delicious cuisine. Day 7 - Hiroshima Sightseeing Today's Hiroshima sightseeing tour will begin with a ferry ride across the beautiful Seto Inland Sea, bound for the island of Miyajima. Considered one of Japan's most scenic spots, this is where you'll visit the 12th-century Itsukushima Shrine and see the famous orange torii gate, which appears to float above the sea. Heading back to Hiroshima, it will be on to the quiet, leafy space of the Peace Memorial Park. Dotted with memorials and tranquil spaces for reflection, visit the cenotaph displaying the names of all those who lost their lives in the catastrophe before heading on to the Memorial Museum. Exhibits such as ragged clothes, a melted lunchbox and a watch frozen in time at 8.15am bring home the horror of a day that changed history forever. Your tour will end at the UNESCO-listed Peace Memorial, the only building in the city to survive the bomb. This afternoon, perhaps opt to join the ‘Secrets of Hiroshima' Choice Experience. Day 8 - Hiroshima - Himeji Heading on from Hiroshima, this morning you'll journey on to Himeji, a city best known for its beautiful and fairy tale-esque 400-year-old castle. After some free time for lunch and exploring the city your way, this afternoon you'll meet up with a Local Guide to visit the UNESCO-listed castle. Known as the White Heron Castle, this site is widely considered Japan's most spectacular castle and looking up at its vast size, beauty and stunning gardens, it won't be hard to see why. Learn about its history before heading on to your hotel for an evening free to spend however you choose. Day 9 - Himeji - Osaka On the last full day of your Japan tour package, perhaps start with a visit to a sake brewery led by your Local Guide. Made with a combination of quality rice, clean water, koji mould and yeast, sake is the drink that compliments just about anything in Japan. Learn about its history and brewing process before heading on to the final destination of your Japanese adventure, Osaka, a spirited and liberal city. With an afternoon free to explore your way, explore this neon sign loving metropolis or take advantage of our Chioce Experience to the Umeda Sky Building and Osaka Castle. Standing at 170 metres tall, admire the views of the city from the Floating Garden Observatory before heading on to the striking castle to delve into the rich collection of paintings, samurai costumes and historical artefacts that are housed within its walls. This evening and to see out your trip in style, you can opt to join a foodie inspired experience to Namba, Osaka's dining and entertainment hub, for a final feast of local delights. Day 10 - Depart Osaka Culturally satisfied after your incredible Japan journey. Leave with big smiles courtesy of Japan's faultless hospitality. Say sayonara to your fellow travellers.
