With an ingenious mix of contemporary design elements with traditional building structures and artworks throughout designed by award-winning architects, the Hotel itself is a work of art. A handsome row of historic warehouses and former IXL jam factory dating from the 1820's have been creatively transformed into an enthralling and luxurious first class hotel showcasing the work of Tasmania's finest visual artists. The hotel is itself a fusion of art, heritage, technology and tradition. Located on Hobart's Victoria dock, most of the 56 rooms have close harbour and water views where you can watch fishing trawlers slip quietly into view just beneath your window, while others overlook the stunning glass Atrium and reveal glimpses of the old jam factory interior.
