Find delicious cuisine at hole-in-the-wall eateries in Ho Chi Minh City, stroll the winding streets of Hanoi’s Old Quarter, laugh yourself silly at the water puppet theatre at Hoan Kiem and see ancient temples and pagodas alongside modern houses from a cyclo. Make your own colourful lanterns in UNESCO’s Hoi An, explore the Forbidden Purple City in Hue and enjoy a home-cooked meal with a local family. With 12 days to adventure from the exciting chaos of Ho Chi Minh to the towering limestone karsts of UNESCO World Heritage-listed Ha Long Bay, you and the kids will get all the highlights of diverse Vietnam in one neat package. Itinerary Day 1: Ho Chi Minh City Xin chao! Welcome to Vietnam. When you arrive at the airport, you’ll be met by a local representative and transferred to your hotel. Your adventure begins in Ho Chi Minh City with a welcome meeting at 5 pm to meet the other families joining your trip and your local leader. After, you’ll all head out as a group for a welcome dinner and tuck into some delicious local cuisine. If you'd like to spend more time exploring Ho Chi Minh City or join a tour to Cu Chi Tunnels before your trip begins, speak to your booking agent ahead of time to organise additional accommodation here. Day 2: Mekong Delta - Ho Chi Minh City Today, you'll travel south by private minibus and spend the day exploring the Mekong Delta – often referred to as ‘the rice bowl of Vietnam’. Board a private boat and traverse the intricate waterways, soaking up the sounds and admiring the waterside views as you float through this fertile landscape. Disembark at Ben Tre and visit the coconut gardens, stopping at a local home to sample tropical fruits and coconut jams before paddling in sampans (small rowing boats). Take a tuk-tuk tour around the villages, learning about rural life and how the locals make their living. Enjoy lunch with a local family in the heart of the delta. Then, it’s back to the boat to cruise the delta’s major waterways to Ben Tre boat pier. After the cruise, return via bus to Ho Chi Minh City. Day 3: Hoi An This morning, say goodbye to Ho Chi Minh City and fly north to Danang where you’ll take a short transfer to the UNESCO World Heritage-listed Hoi An. With a beautifully preserved Old Town, parts of the city look exactly as they did more than a century ago. Your leader will take you on an orientation walk around the Old Quarter where you can take in the beautiful architecture and sights, including the display of lanterns and boats along the river. You and the kids will then join a local artisan to make your very own lanterns to take home! After the lantern workshop, head out for a delicious dinner in town before heading back to the hotel. Day 4: Hoi An This morning, head out to one of Hoi An's best beaches, known for the palm-fringed white sands and views of the Cham Islands. You’ll spend some time here enjoying the sun, sand and clear waters. A picnic lunch is included, so all you have to do is relax and enjoy the beach day! This afternoon, you’re free to explore, relax or shop at your own pace. Maybe you’re feeling active, so you’ll choose to hire bikes for a ride through the countryside. Or relax by the pool while the kids enjoy some more time to swim. Day 5: Hoi An Today is free for you to spend as you like. You might like to venture into the Old Town to further explore the beautifully preserved streets and shops. Hoi An is one of the best places to shop for souvenirs, especially if you're looking for t-shirts, paintings or ceramics. This area has also become famous for its tailoring, with a great variety of fabrics and tailors to choose from, so you can indulge in a new, custom outfit. Not keen on shopping? Your leader can also assist with arranging any optional activities you might like to do – maybe join a family-friendly cooking class that includes a boat ride and farm tour or simply spend more time relaxing at the beach or hotel pool. Day 6: Hue This morning after breakfast, head back on the road and make your way past coastal rice paddies, taking in the views from the mountains as you cross the scenic Hai Van Pass. Arriving in the city of Hue - the former imperial capital of Vietnam and tonight's destination – there will be some free time to relax before exploring the streets on a cyclo tour! The kids will love travelling around the citadel, passing through the local fruit and vegetable market and stopping at Ho Chi Minh’s house on the three-wheeled pedaled taxi. Later enjoy a delicious home cooked dinner with a local family. Get to know the local culture with good conversation and some authentic flavours made with fresh ingredients. Day 7: Hue - Overnight train Delve further into the former capital today with a visit the Imperial Citadel, which is the best-preserved remnant of a large Citidel and Royal Centre that once existed on this fortified site. The unique fortifications are fascinating, even though much of this place has sadly been destroyed by war. Explore the foliage-covered ruins, then visit the Forbidden Purple City, which was almost totally wiped out during the Tet Offensive in 1968. The gaping holes left by bombs give an idea of the shocking destruction wreaked upon the country during the war. Tonight, board an overnight train bound for Hanoi. Day 8: Hanoi Arrive in Hanoi early this morning and enjoy some free time to relax, refresh and recharge before visiting a Vun Art – a local social enterprise and an Intrepid Foundation partner, Vun Art helps empower people living with disabilities in Vietnam by providing vocational training and employment opportunities. Hear about their story and have the chance to make an artwork of your own to take home. Tonight, you’ll head out with your family to experience a unique water puppet show – an ancient art in Vietnam. Day 9: Hanoi This morning head to the Museum of Ethnology to learn more about the diverse heritage of Vietnam. Then visit the Temple of Literature before enjoying some lunch at the KOTO restaurant – an excellent establishment and long-time friend of Intrepid which lives by the philosophy of 'know one, teach one'. It supports underprivileged local youth by giving them a chance at making a career in hospitality. Day 10: Halong Bay Travel by minibus to the spectacular World Heritage-listed site of Halong Bay (approximately 4 hours). The bay is a breathtaking secluded harbour with some 2000 limestone islands jutting out of the waters of the Bac Bo Gulf. Board your private boat and cruise among the dramatic limestone peaks. There's an opportunity to swim in the famous Vietnam East Sea and explore caves filled with stunning stalactites and stalagmites. Spend a peaceful night on board, beneath a sky alive with stars. Day 11: Hanoi Enjoy breakfast on the boat this morning and consider heading out for an optional early morning kayak to see the karsts, junk boats and still waters from a new perspective. Later, return to Hanoi by bus. When you arrive, check into your hotel and spend some free time freshening up or recharging before joining your group for a final dinner together to celebrate a trip well travelled. Day 12: Hanoi With no further activities planned after breakfast this morning, your trip comes to an end and you’re free to depart the hotel at any time after checking out. If you’d like to extend your stay in Hanoi and continue exploring the Old Quarter, just speak to your booking agent ahead of time to organize additional accommodation.
