Ciao! Welcome to Venice. This watery wonderland of bridges, towers, piazzas, canals, churches and gondolas – practically unchanged for 600 years – is literally sinking under the weight of its iconic sites. There are no activities planned before tonight's welcome meeting at 6 pm, so if you arrive early, there are plenty of things to keep you busy. The Grand Canal is a great place to start, as you can stroll over the Rialto Bridge and browse the endless boutique shops selling Venetian masks and handmade Murano glassware. Tonight, discover some moreish Venetian bites on a cicchetti crawl through the city's fabulous bacari (wine bars). Day 2 Venice. After breakfast, venture out and explore Venice. There are only two ways to get around this city – on foot or by boat. This morning, get a taste of both. Take the Vaporetto (water bus) over to the island of San Giorgio to climb the bell tower for the best view of Venice. Your afternoon is free to take a trip in a Venetian gondola, enjoy an espresso and people watch in San Marco Square or discover the artwork at the Palazzo Ducale or the Peggy Guggenheim Collection. In the evening, maybe join your fellow travellers for a group dinner at a local restaurant. Venice is famous for its specialities of fresh lobster and squid ink spaghetti dishes, so make sure you give one a try. Day 3 La Spezia. Spend the day travelling by train to the once important naval base of La Spezia – now the gateway to the Cinque Terre (Five Lands). The name comes from the five tiny villages – Riomaggiore, Manarola, Corniglia, Venranzza, Monterosso – whose position, wedged into a series of coves between sheer cliffs, makes it one of the highlights of the whole of Italy. When you arrive in La Spezia there won't be too much time to explore, but after checking into your hotel, you can get your bearings with a short walk around the pedestrian zone on Via del Prione to the gardens along the harbour or head out for dinner with the group. Day 4 La Spezia / Cinque Terre. This morning, venture out on the footpaths of the Cinque Terre for a leader-led hike. The footpaths between the villages were once the only way to travel in the region and take you through olive groves and vineyards. You can walk just a few sections, as some path sections can be difficult with challenging uphill stretches, narrow sections, steep cliffs and foot bridges. If you’re not up for the hike, you can take the train between the villages or back to the group's base. After working up an appetite, take advantage of the Liguria region with a pesto-making demonstration and the chance to create your own pesto. Of course, you’ll try your creation with a glass of wine afterwards. The rest of the day is free. In the evening, there's no better way to recover from your day of walking than with more indulgence in delicious Mediterranean food. Day 5 Pisa - Florence. Depart Cinque Terre today and catch a train to Pisa. Divided in two by the River Arno, the heart of Pisa is the Santa Maria quarter on the north bank. You can visit the world-famous Leaning Tower, as well as the Duomo (Piazza dei Miracoli, once the largest in Europe) and Pisa Baptistry, or explore the town, maybe enjoying lunch and an aperitif in a backstreet restaurant. Return to the station in the afternoon and take the train to Florence. After checking into your hotel, the rest of your evening is free to explore the city of the Renaissance. Day 6 Florence. Today is free for you to explore all that Florence has to offer. It's impossible to see everything in this Renaissance wonderland, so take your time to work out a plan. The principal sights are easily discovered on foot – the Pitti Palace, Ponte Vecchio, Arno riverside, the many statues and monuments of the Piazza della Signoria, Palazzo Vecchio, Santa Maria del Fiore cathedral, the Baptistry and the Belltower, and the Santa Croce Church. Otherwise, you can visit the Uffizi – one of the world's oldest art galleries and a work of art in itself. If you want to see Michelangelo's iconic statue of David, head to the Galleria dell’ Accademia. In the evening, climb the steep stairs uphill to Piazzale Michelangelo for a renowned sunset view across the rooftops of Florence before an included dinner of Tuscan specialties at a local restaurant. Day 7 Perugia. After a free morning in Florence, travel by train to Perugia. The once-Roman settlement of Perugia sits atop a rocky hill with views over the green hills of the Umbria region and is now a university town with one of Italy's largest schools. When you arrive, head out on an orientation walk of the city’s medieval streets. For an insight into local history, use your free time this afternoon to visit the National Gallery of Umbria – an impressive collection of Umbrian art housed in the Palazzo dei Priori (a grand stone building from the 13th century). With the city's population of students filling the streets with nightlife, you might like to head out tonight and explore. Pause for a glass of prosecco along Corso Vannucci, the city’s main street, as you take a very Italian passeggiata. Day 8 Perugia / Spello. Take a train to the nearby medieval town of Spello – a Roman town that straddles a thin ridge at the base of Mount Subasio, which is the mountain where St Francis was said to have talked to the animals. It’s a place known for its wine and rural charm. Two of the local churches feature frescoes by famed Renaissance painter Pinturicchio, who later lent his hand to works in the Vatican and Siena’s Cathedral. Sample the local wine and regional delicacies with lunch at a local enoteca. Tartufo and porcini make up the base of many pasta and risotto dishes, while whole stuffed pig with rosemary is a signature dish of the region. Back in Perugia, the rest of your evening is free. Day 9 Rome. This morning, take a comfortable bus to Rome and remember that while here, the best attitude is ‘when in Rome’! Join your leader on an orientation walk around the city, where you will pass by some of the iconic sights such as the Colosseum (one of the Seven Wonders of the World) and Arch of Constantine, the Forum, Piazza Navona, the Pantheon, the Trevi Fountain and Spanish Steps. If you have time take a visit to the Vatican City and St Peter's Basilica. Entry to the Basilica is free, and there's a small charge to climb the dome for a panorama over the city. Head out to the Trastevere region tonight with your group for a final farewell dinner – this artsy part of the city is always a great spot for dinner, drinks and wandering around the winding lanes in the evening. Your local restaurant for tonight – Trattoria De Gli Amici – is run by a social cooperative promoted by the community of Sant ‘Egidio – they train and employ people living with disabilities, supported by management and locals. Day 10 Rome. There are no activities planned today, and your trip will come to an end. If you’d like to extend your stay in Rome (and it’s recommended that you do), just speak to your booking agent. What You'll Love about this Trip Take a daytrip to Perugia’s ancient town of Spello. Walk the winding laneways and cobbled streets, then sample the local wine and regional delicacies at a local enoteca for lunch. See some iconic sites like the canals of Venice, the Duomo’s gorgeous exterior in Florence and the endless sights of Rome. Find out why these cities are loved by so many and enjoy plenty of free time to make your own discoveries. Eat your way through this foodie’s paradise with a cicchetti (small bites) tour in Venice, a pesto-making class in Cinque Terre and a local leader to point out all the best spots for espresso, gelato, wine and pasta. Explore Cinque Terre with a group hike – a series of walking paths connect the pastel villages of Monterosso, Corniglia and Riomaggiore. (make sure you bring your camera). Support the local community with a farewell dinner in Trastevere – a gorgeous area in Rome popular for its summer dining and aperitif culture – at a local cooperative that employs people living with disabilities and provides hospitality training.
