Or Boorloo in the language of the local Whadjuk Nyoongar people, who are the Traditional Owners of the land on which Perth is now located. Your adventure begins straight away, as you meet your group and head to Nambung National Park to check out the famous Pinnacles Desert – a unique landscape unlike any other in the country. After, journey to Jurien Bay, where you’ll have the opportunity to spot endangered sea lions on the beach. From here, continue to the limestone caves of Stockyard Gully Reserve before spending the night in the coastal city of Geraldton. Day 2 Hutt Lagoon to Kalbarri Drive to Kalbarri after breakfast, stopping at Hutt Lagoon on the way – the extremely high levels of salinity in this lagoon gives it its unusual pink, sometimes lilac hue. Stop along the rugged coastline to see the natural bridge and take a short walk along the coastal trail. This afternoon, head to Murchison River for a special degustation experience. After a tour around Murchison House Station, you’ll head out on the river in canoes, drifting along the gentle waters and looking out for some local wildlife. As the sun goes down, you’ll leave your canoes and tuck into your campfire banquet – this four-course feast of regional dishes will be paired with alcohol or non-alcoholic drinks, set against the gorgeous backdrop of Kalbarri’s nature. Day 3 Kalbarri National Park to Shark Bay Wake up and explore Kalbarri National Park's Skywalk and Nature’s Window. After, you’ll carry on to Shark Bay. Walk along Eagle Bluff Boardwalk for views of the harbour, limestone islands and wildlife (you might be lucky enough to see rays, sharks or even turtles here), then enjoy some free time for lunch in Denham. Continue to your accommodation in Monkey Mia. Tonight is a free night in Shark Bay. Day 4 Shark Bay Today is a free day to soak up all the natural beauty of Shark Bay – this UNESCO World Heritage Area is one of the world's greatest wilderness treasures set on the westernmost point of Australia. You might like to go stand-up paddleboarding, kayaking or 4WDing here – there are heaps of optional activities that your leader can help you book. You might even like to take a daytrip to Dirk Hartog Island to explore the wilderness in a 4WD – on this tour, you’ll visit the blow holes of the island, walk on white-sand beaches, swim through clear bay waters and look out for sharks, turtles, whales, dugongs and dolphins from Surf Point Marine Sanctuary. Spend tonight around the campfire and enjoy a tasting of fresh seafood or bush tucker cooked over the fire. Learn about the history of the Gutharraguda (Shark Bay), hear a Traditional Custodian play the didgeridoo and try spot kangaroos and echidnas. Day 5 Shell Beach to Carnarvon to Coral Bay It will be a bit of a long travel day today as you make your way to Coral Bay, bordered by the UNESCO World Heritage-listed Ningaloo Reef – the world's largest fringing reef, home to thriving marine life and rare flora and fauna. The reef sits within the national park of the same name and is also the spot where up to 500 whale sharks aggregate yearly! Along the way, stop in Carnarvon and maybe grab some lunch or visit the Gascoyne Aboriginal Heritage and Cultural Centre (Gwoonwardu Mia), before settling into your accommodation for the evening. Day 6 Ningaloo Reef to Coral Bay Set out on a three-hour glass bottom boat tour this morning, to explore the scenic surroundings of Coral Bay. As you cruise the bright blue waters, go in search of local turtles feeding in the corals of their natural habitat. As well as looking out for turtles, you’ll have the opportunity to feed schools of fish and maybe even go snorkelling in the clear waters off the boat in two different spots! This afternoon, you’re free to kick back on the warm sands, go for a swim or head out for more snorkelling along the Ningaloo Reef. Day 7 Ningaloo Reef to Exmouth Drive into Cape Range National Park this morning and head out on a walk to Mandu Mandu Gorge. Venture up to the gorge’s rim to see the vast views of the Ningaloo Reef and surrounding country. Keep an eye out for wildlife as you go, like black-flanked rock-wallabies and birds of prey. After, have a picnic lunch with your group, then cool off with some snorkelling around Oyster Stacks – these five isolated islets protrude from Ningaloo Reef and can only be accessed at high tide. Explore the shallow coral gardens below the water, among colourful schools of fish – keep an eye out for turtles and sharks cruising by! Tonight, make your way to Exmouth. Day 8 Exmouth Your trip comes to an end this morning and you can depart the hotel at any time. If you are interested in the opportunity to go on an (optional) experience of a lifetime and swim with whale sharks – the world’s biggest fish – off Western Australia’s Coral Coast we recommend you book early as this activity can sell our well in advance.
