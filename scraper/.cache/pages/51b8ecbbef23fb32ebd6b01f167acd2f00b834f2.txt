The Middle East offers a kaleidoscope of unforgettable experiences, blending rich heritage with contemporary charm at every turn. From spectacular ancient ruins to ultra-modern cities, desert landscapes to luxurious retreats, this region effortlessly blends tradition with innovation. Whether you're craving culture, relaxation, adventure, or flavours you'll never forget, the Middle East promises pinch-me moments around every corner. Talk to our Middle East travel specialists and let us craft your perfect dream holiday through this region, today! Flight time. Flying from Auckland to major Middle Eastern destinations is possible with a direct flight to Doha and Dubai with flight times of 17 to 18 hours. Best time to go. For UAE, November to March where temperatures are more pleasant for outdoor activities. For Egypt, October to April, with cooler temperatures making it easier to explore historical sites. Time difference. Middle East spans several time zones, but most countries are around 9 to 10 hours behind New Zealand Standard Time (NZST, GMT +12). Our favourite Middle East destinations Egypt Egypt is a bucket list destination for so many of us – who didn’t grow up with images of pyramids and the Sphinx etched into our memories from storybooks and movies? The only trouble is figuring out how to fit it all in. Egypt Jordan Jordan is a land where history, culture and stunning landscapes come together in a tapestry of marvels. Be awe-struck by the rose-red city of Petra, float effortlessly in the Dead Sea, or explore the Mars-like beauty of Wadi Rum – where the sunsets feel otherworldly. Jordan United Arab Emirates Wander through Dubai’s glittering souks and mega malls, explore Al Ain’s historic forts and desert oases, or lose yourself in the maze-like streets of old Sharjah – a UNESCO Cultural Capital. Marvel at the grandeur of Abu Dhabi’s Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque, or head out on a 4WD safari across the golden dunes of the Empty Quarter.

I have travelled a lot of the world and now love to do so with my family.

Nicci Sarah Martelli House of Travel Rotorua Lovely to meet you! My love for travel began early—at 19, I left New Zealand with a one-way ticket to London to start my OE, and I’ve never looked back. I spent eight years living overseas, including four incredible years in London, where I explored Europe extensively. (Barcelona still has my heart!) I began my travel career in Melbourne in 2004, and I knew I’d found my dream job. Even now, I still smile every day coming to work—I truly LOVE what I do.
