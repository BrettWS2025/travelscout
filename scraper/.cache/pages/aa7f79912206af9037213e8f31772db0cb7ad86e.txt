Towering royal palms march in a long, orderly row from the main street to the harbor and into the heart of the city. Although Lautoka grew up around the Fijan village of Namoli, it is a very Indian town today. Day 2: Nabukeru, Yasawa Island, Fiji Nabukeru, Yasawa Island, Fiji May 04, 2026 Arrives: 08:00 AM Departs: 01:00 PM Fiji's islands are often grouped into different regions, based on both geographical isolation from other groups, but also cultural similarities between islands. The Yasawa Islands are on Fiji's far western edge and are an excellent location for adventure, both on land and underwater. The Yasawa group is quite unusual, even by Fijian standards. The islands were actually closed to tourism until 1987 because the local king did not want visitors. The saltwater caves of Sawa I Lau are turquoise pools made famous from the movie 'Blue Lagoon.' The entrance to the second cave is through a hidden underwater entrance carved by the sea into the limestone. The caves are steeped in myths and legends. The small village of Nabukeru sits near the beach on an isolated and beautiful spot. Climate change and its impacts are being felt here, with coastal inundation and tropical cyclones bringing waves over the sea walls that once kept villagers safe. INCLUDED EXPEDITION: Yasawa Island Venture into the majestic Sawa-I-Lau Caves to experience Fiji’s ancient limestone formations on this private tour aided by local guides to explore the secrets within. The limestone formations, carved by constant wave action are hidden within an attractive little island. The sacred Caves are also known as the resting place of the 10-headed ancient Fijian god, Ulutini. The first of the caverns is simply magnificent. Sun light filters through a hole in the ceiling, allowing a glamorous beauty of the underwater world reflects upon the surface of the water. If you are up for more excitement you can choose to enter a second cave which is more secretive, cavern via an underwater tunnel. Included as well is a visit to a nearby village of Tamusua - the traditional owners of the famous Sawa I Lau cave. Explorer and take advantage of the wonderful moment spent with the friendly villagers. Please bring underwater camera, reef friendly sunscreen, snorkel gear and reef shoes. Day 3: At Sea At Sea May 04, 2026 Arrives: 12:00 AM Departs: 11:59 PM Day 4: Ambrym, Vanuatu Ambrym, Vanuatu May 06, 2026 Arrives: 07:00 AM Departs: 01:00 PM The volcanic island of Ambrym, one of Vanuatu’s outer islands, is spectacular. With the twin volcanoes of Benbow and Marum rising steeply from the azure waters, and a 12 km caldera to explore , the eruption in year AD50 that formed this caldera was one of the biggest in recent geological history. The black volcanic soils on this island make for a wonderful backdrop on which to view the Rom dances. Ambrym is considered to be the country’s center of sorcery, as active volcanoes mean stronger magic. A ceremonial ritual, the Rom dance is a sacred masked dance with origins that go back centuries. Involving only men, the dance delves into the age-old struggle between good and evil and is also believed to play a big role in influencing harvests. Full of secrecy and symbolism, the ability to witness such a dance is a special and profound experience. Day 4: Pentecost Island, Vanuatu Pentecost Island, Vanuatu May 06, 2026 Arrives: 03:00 PM Departs: 08:00 PM As might be guessed, Pentecost Island was named by a European explorer who sighted it on the day of Pentecost, 22 May 1768. That explorer was the Frenchman Louis Antoine de Bougainville. A lush, mountainous island without any real towns, islanders are subsistence farmers and fishermen. The island is most famous for an activity that inspired bungee jumping. Originally a ritual called nanggol, or land-diving, men would construct tall towers, tie vines to their feet and jump off them. The purpose of the ritual was a fertility manhood ritual, and also to ensure a good harvest of yams. The vines tied to the ankles of the men were springy, and the lengths calculated just right so the men would brush the ground lightly and therefore survive the fall. Witnessing this ritual and filmed by the BBC in the 1950s, is believed to have led to the modern sport of bungee jumping. INCLUDED EXPEDITION: Visit ashore to see the seasonal ritual of Land Diving Day 5: Luganville, Vanuatu Luganville, Vanuatu May 07, 2026 Arrives: 06:00 AM Departs: 05:00 PM Espiritu Santo Island is the largest in Vanuatu and the seat of the provincial capital, in Luganville. The island's unusual name (for Vanuatu) dates back to a Spanish exploration of the region in the 17th century. The name given by the leader of the expedition, Portuguese Navigator Pedro Fernández de Quirós was Terra Austrialia del Espiritu Santo. The name 'Austrialia' was said to be a reference to the Hapsburg rulers of Spain (in Austria) and the yet-undiscovered southern continent referred to as Terra Australis.​ ​During WWII, Luganville was the site of an Allied military installment. At the end of the war, instead of returning most of the supplies and equipment back to their origins, it was sent off into the ocean and left behind. This has contributed significantly to dive and snorkel tourism in the region, including an area called 'Million Dollar Point', for the amount money said to be scuttled there in wrecks under the sea. Day 6-8: At Sea At Sea May 08 - 10, 2026 Arrives: 12:00 AM Departs: 11:59 PM Day 9: Alotau, Papua New Guinea Alotau, Papua New Guinea May 11, 2026 Arrives: 07:00 AM Departs: 05:00 PM Alotau, Papua New Guinea. Alotau is the capital of the Milne Bay province of Papua New Guinea, located on a peninsula in Milne Bay in the Coral Sea. The town and water comprise the site of the 1942 battle of Milne Bay, in which the invading Japanese army suffered its first decisive defeat in the Pacific Theater of World War II at the hands of Allied, mostly Australian forces. A War Memorial commemorates the battle. Today the area is largely given over the palm oil plantations. The local people keep their Tawala cultural traditions alive, with the exception of the long-past ritual cannibalism. In Bibiko Village, they will be pleased to show them off in displays of prowess with Kundu drum ceremonies and exhibitions of their impressive war canoes. At the Ahioma village of Dodobana, the many specialized skills of daily Melanesian life are demonstrated in a family-style setting, such as basket weaving, grass skirt making and gardening. Day 10: Conflict Islands (Panawal Group), Papua New Guinea Conflict Islands (Panawal Group), Papua New Guinea May 12, 2026 (Tender by Zodiac) Arrives: 07:00 AM Departs: 01:00 PM Don’t let the name scare you. This idyllic archipelago of 21 coral atolls off the coast of New Guinea was named after the British ship HMS Conflict by its discoverer, a most patriotic captain. You could hardly ask for a more conflict-free paradise. The island group is privately owned by a passionate conservationist, who insists on sustainable methods for any activity within his tropical domain. Activities are therefore tailored for enjoying the exceptionally beautiful beaches, the supremely biodiverse coral reefs and the clear, warm waters. Kayaking, snorkeling and paddle-boarding are the more strenuous varieties. Simply relaxing mindfully on the sugary fringes of the lagoon are also acceptable. The area is under consideration for UNESCO World Heritage inscription. Day 11-12: At Sea At Sea May 13-14, 2026 Arrive: 12:00 AM Depart: 11:59 PM Day 13-14: Agats, Indonesia Agats, Indonesia May 15-16, 2026 Arrives: 10:00 AM Departs: 04:00 PM Overnight. Day 15: At Sea At Sea May 17, 2026 Arrive: 12:00 AM Depart: 11:59 PM Day 16-17: Darwin, Australia Darwin, Australia May 18-19, 2026 Arrives: 07:00 AM ​Capital of the Northern Territory (NT), with an estimated population of 150,000, Darwin is home to most of the Northern Territory population. The Darwin region, like much of the Top End, experiences a tropical climate with a wet and dry season and boasts a vibrant multicultural community, where Indigenous heritage blends seamlessly with the influence of diverse international populations. Darwin's rich history provides an incredible background for the diverse cultural and historical activities. On the 9th September 1839, HMS Beagle sailed into Darwin harbor during its survey of the area. John Clements Wickham named the region “Port Darwin” in honor of their former shipmate Charles Darwin. The city has been rebuilt almost entirely four times, following cyclones and Japanese air raids in World War II.
