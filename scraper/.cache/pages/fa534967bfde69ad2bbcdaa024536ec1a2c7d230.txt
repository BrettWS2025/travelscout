Please check price at time of booking Itinerary Day - 1 Location: Quito - Bienvenidos! Welcome to Ecuador. Your adventure begins in Quito – Ecuador’s sprawling capital city. You’ll have a welcome meeting at 5 or 6 pm tonight to meet your local leader and small group of fellow travellers. If you arrive early, maybe check out the city at your own pace – head to the Old Town and pick one (or more) of the 30 churches to explore. After your meeting, you’ll head to a small, local restaurant for dinner with your group. Take in the aromas and fresh flavours of the traditional Ecuadorian cuisine – think locroc (traditional potato soup) or quinoa, pork and vegetable dishes cooked with herbs, lemongrass and rich sauces, all sourced from local farms. Day - 2 Location: Quito - Isla Baltra - Las Bachas (Isla Santa Cruz) - You have a very early start this morning (maybe as early as 4 am, depending on flight times) as you head into the Galapagos. Transfer to Mariscal Sucre International Airport (Quito Airport), with a boxed breakfast on the way. When you arrive, you’ll meet your naturalist guide in the arrival hall, then be transferred to your boat – Le Grande Daphne. Meet the crew, settle in and have some lunch with your fellow travellers. Try on the snorkelling gear before your first snorkelling session, then sail to Las Bachas, where the soft sand made of decomposed coral is a nesting site for the Pacific green turtle. Marine iguanas are also commonly spotted along the beach. The rocks make for excellent snorkelling and are populated by Sally Lightfoot crabs. A saltwater lagoon just near the beach is home to flamingo and whimbrel and you might also see a great blue heron. Remnants of a floating pier, a testimony to the US presence in the Galapagos during World War II, can also be seen. Day - 3 Location: Isla Rabida - Punta Albermarle (Isla Isabela) - Today, you’ll sail from Las Bachas to Isla Rabida, known for its spectacular red sand beaches, caused by the high content of iron in the sand which rusts to form the unusual shade. From the shore, follow today’s hiking trail to a lagoon that’s one of the best spots in the Galapagos to see flamingos. Keep an eye out for nesting pelicans, pintail ducks, marine iguanas and sea lions, too. Check out a vast opuntia cactus forest, hinting at the previous habitation of land iguanas, Galapagos hawks, mockingbirds, doves, finches and lava lizards. After, you can opt to go snorkelling to seek out the resident sea stars, damsels, gobbies and surgeon fish. In the afternoon, head to Albemarle on the northeast side of Isabela Island. Covered in mangroves, the bay is home to sea turtles, sea lions, penguins and flightless cormorants who feed on the algae and fish here. Another fantastic location for snorkelling, you may like to have a look beneath the water’s surface in search of sea turtles and flightless cormorants. Day - 4 Location: Tagus Cove (Isla Isabela) - Bahia Urbina (Isla Isabela) - Sail overnight from Punta Albermarle around to the western shores of Isla Isabela. Wake up near Tagus Cove, where pirates and whalers used to collect tortoises for their travels. Maybe go snorkelling here or check out the graffiti on the walls (the oldest of which is from 1836!). Look out for flightless cormorants, blue-footed boobies, a variety of waterfowl and the most northerly penguins in the world. You’ll then walk to a lookout point for a stunning view of the north of Isabela Island and Volcan Wolf (Wolf Volcano). Later, visit Bahia Urbina on the west of Isabela Island to see the bay’s diverse and colourful plant life, which attracts many different insects. The site also features a short hike inland, where giant tortoises can be spotted among the bushes. You may also see land iguanas, which often nest in the middle of the trail. Flycatchers, Darwin’s finches and mockingbirds are common on the ground and in the trees. Day - 5 Location: Punta Espinosa (Isla Fernandina) - Punta Vicente Roca (Isla Isabela) - Today, visit Punta Espinosa – a narrow ledge of lava and sand extending from the base of La Cumbre volcano. Walk around the peninsula to see the lava cacti, marine iguanas, barking sea lions, tiny penguins and Sally Lightfoot crabs. Keep an eye out for the Galapagos hawk, too, hunting in the treetops. Then, dive into the clear waters for snorkelling, looking out for the resident turtles and sea lions. In the afternoon, head to Punta Vicente Roca and take a Zodiac ride to see the abundant wildlife here. This spot is also one of the best snorkelling spots in the archipelago! The route takes you along the cliffs and allows you to explore two shallow underwater caves. The primitive and unaggressive bullhead shark, known locally as the Port Jackson shark, is often seen here sharing its space with red-lipped batfish, frogfish, Pacific seahorses, the endemic Camotillo, schools of barracuda and brown-stripped snappers. Day - 6 Location: Puerto Egas (Isla Santiago) - Caleta Bucanero (Isla Santiago) - Sail to Puerto Egas – a black-sand beach on the west side of James Bay, northwest of Isla Santiago. Home to incredible volcanic tuff formations, you’ll stroll along the beach with the native marine iguanas, pelicans, finches, mockingbirds, oystercatchers, Galapagos sea lions and Galapagos fur seals. You can see the tidal pools, formed from ancient lava flow, providing a home for sponges, snails, hermit crabs, barnacles and fish. You might also end up snorkelling with a Galapagos fur seal – they’re always looking for a friend! In the afternoon, travel to the northwest side of Santiago Island where you’ll find Caleta Bucanero – named after the pirates and buccaneers who once found shelter in the bay. Here, you can go snorkelling and take a dinghy ride to look for blue-footed boobies, pelicans and nocturnal seagulls nesting in the cliffs. Day - 7 Location: Isla Bartolome - Isla Sombrero Chino - Wake up in Bartolome Island – a volcanic landscape full of spatter cones and lava flows, home to Galapagos penguins and lava lizards. Put on your walking shoes and climb up 360 wooden steps to the summit, where an amazing view of Pinnacle Rock awaits. This is one of the most photographed sights in the Galapagos! Hike to the top of a once-active volcano and enjoy the views across to Bahia Sullivan on nearby Isla Santiago. If you’re in luck, you might see the Galapagos hawk. There’s also the chance to go snorkelling among the colourful marine life. In the afternoon, travel to the small island of Sombrero Chino, found on the southeast side of Santiago Island. With sandy beaches and a volcanic landscape, this is a great spot to hike and look out for the sea lions and penguins that rest here. Or, you can snorkel in search of reef sharks and sea turtles. Day - 8 Location: Isla North Seymour - Charles Darwin Research Station (Isla Santa Cruz) - Wake up in North Seymour – one of the most visited islands of the Galapagos. Take a morning walk around the island to see blue-footed boobies and swallow-tailed gulls. Boobies and frigates have an interesting relationship, sharing the same nesting area on North Seymour. Blue-footed boobies nest on the ground while the frigate birds nest just above them in the saltbushes. As you walk, look out for land iguanas, marine iguanas, Galapagos sea lions and the endemic incense tree. After, cool off and go snorkelling to see the variety of fish and white-tipped reef sharks, rays and sea lions here. Later, travel to Isla Santa Cruz – the second largest island in the Galapagos. Visit the Charles Darwin Research Station – undertaking vital conservation work, the station also makes for interesting exploration and offers the best opportunities for close encounters with giant tortoises. You may also see baby tortoises! Day - 9 Location: Puerto Ayora - Santa Cruz Highlands - Baltra - Quito - Flights to the mainland depart mid-morning, so it’s an early start for your last morning on the islands today. You’ll visit the Santa Cruz Highlands first, travelling through the agricultural region and into the misty forests, where you can see the dome-shaped giant tortoises in the wild. Look out for different species of Darwin finches and the world-famous woodpecker and warbler finches. Then, it’s time to bid farewell to the archipelago and head to the airport for your mid-morning flight back to Quito for the last night of the trip. You'll arrive at about 4 pm, taking a transfer back to your hotel. You might want to head out with your fellow travellers for dinner tonight, toasting to an incredible, wildlife-filled adventure. Day - 10 Location: Quito - There are no activities planned for today, and your adventure finishes after breakfast this morning. Of course, that doesn’t mean your adventure has to end! Why not stay on in Quito for a few days and discover the charms of the city. If you need help booking extra accommodation, just speak to your booking agent ahead of time.
