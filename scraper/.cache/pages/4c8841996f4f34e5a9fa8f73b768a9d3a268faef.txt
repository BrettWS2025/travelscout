With a population of over 136,000 inhabitants, French is the main language used in the city, followed by Tahitian. A bustling, lively city with colorful market, parks, shops and cafes, you can buy fresh fish, sarongs, vanilla beans or pearls among other delights. A waterfront promenade with music and food, and a multicultural population add to the city’s allure. Papeete, meaning “water basket” was once the place where Tahitians came to collect fresh water. Polynesian culture, its art, and the history of the island that includes French nuclear weapons testing and the mutiny on the HMS Bounty, can be explored in various museums and cultural centers. With the capital situated on the coast, this means most of the island’s inhabitants are also residing near the shore. The interior of Tahiti is mountainous and rugged with cascading waterfalls, caves and lush foliage. Day 2: Anaa, French Polynesia Anaa, French Polynesia October 17, 2026 Arrives: 12:00 PM Departs: 05:00 PM Anaa is a small atoll in the Tuamotu Islands of French Polynesia. Known for its friendly people and its stunningly beautiful lagoon, Anaa is a lovely place to visit. ​The exterior of the atoll has beautiful coral and a variety of fish life. The interior of the atoll is calm and perfect for a comfortable swim. The community of Tuuhora has a population of around 350 people. ​Much of the island's current economy is based on the production of copra, but several initiatives have been introduced to create more opportunities for sustainable tourism. These initiatives will hopefully create a more stable population of fish and will create local jobs and opportunities for the community.​ INCLUDED EXPEDITIONS: ​Visit to the village of Tuuhora. Music and dance performance and then time to explore and walk around.​Snorkeling Day 3: Toau, French Polynesia Toau, French Polynesia October 18, 2026 Arrives: 07:00 AM Departs: 12:00 PM Toau is a medium-sized atoll in the Tuamotu Group of French Polynesia, with a large lagoon that is nearly 22 miles in length. Like all of the atolls in the Tuamotus, this was once a volcanic island, which over time formed its own fringing reef. Many, many years later, the central volcanic island sank below the waters of the sea and the fringing reef is all that remains, forming an atoll with a large lagoon. ​ Although the main village on Toau is abandoned, there are several people who have come over from Fakaraka to make a living on the atoll, both in simple pearl farming and in growing coconuts for the copra industry. ​ The lagoon is healthy, with thriving fish populations around its coral bommies and in the passages into and out of the lagoon. Day 3: Fakarava, Tuamotu, French Polynesia Fakarava, Tuamotu, French Polynesia October 18, 2026 Arrives: 02:30 PM Departs: 06:30 PM Fakarava is a very large, rectangular atoll in the Tuamotu Group of French Polynesia. Atolls are the most common island formation in the Tuamotus. They are the remnants of volcanic islands that once existed in these locations. The islands, over time, formed coral reefs around their outer margins, in the way that many existing islands do today. After long periods of time, the islands themselves sank below the surface of the ocean and all that remains now is the fringing reef. Fakarava is a beautiful island with long sandy beaches and a stunning lagoon. Due to the protected waters of the lagoon, Fakarava has a great deal of pearl farming. The small main town at the northeast side of the atoll is called Rotoava and its population is just under 400 inhabitants. The people of Fakarava farm coconuts for copra on shore and pearls in the lagoons. They also host the travelers who flock here to bask on the beaches and snorkel or dive in the luxuriant coral gardens along the shore. At the long spit of Les Sables Roses, the pink blush of the sand reveals its coral origin. The sleepy towns of Rotoava and Tetamanu offer scant attractions for visitors, except for their distinctive rock lighthouses shaped like stepped pyramids. Tetamanu does boast a 19th Century church built of coral rock by missionaries, and an adjoining cemetery with coral rock headstones. Aside from snorkeling or beach-basking, some visitors enjoy a visit to a lagoon pearl farm, to see how the large, flat bivalves are coaxed into creating the treasured gems formed by the lustrous nacre inside their shells. Day 4-6: At Sea At Sea October 19-21, 2026 Arrives: 12:00 AM Departs: 11:59 PM Day 7: Adamstown, Pitcairn Island, Pitcairn Adamstown, Pitcairn Island, Pitcairn October 22, 2026 Arrives: 07:00 AM Departs: 03:00 PM This captivating destination holds a special place in history as the final home of the mutineers from the HMS Bounty in 1790. Immerse yourself in the intriguing tales of their journey as you explore the island's rich cultural heritage. A truly remote island with rugged steep cliffs, the island is only 2 miles long and 1 mile wide. The population of the island is only around 50 people, descended from the mutineers and Tahitians. A unique location with a remarkable history, this destination is one not easily reached, or easily forgotten.​ Day 8: Ducie Island, Pitcairn Ducie Island, Pitcairn October 23, 2026 Arrives: 11:00 AM Departs: 05:00 PM This uninhabited atoll is a hidden gem in the South Pacific Ocean. With its pristine beaches, crystal-clear waters, and abundant marine life, Ducie Island offers an unparalleled paradise for nature lovers and adventure seekers. Due to its remote location and lack of predators, it boasts a population of nesting seabirds, who will lay their eggs right onto the branches of the low shrubs ashore. Snorkel the nearly intact coral reef surrounding the island. If conditions permit, make a landing at this remote destination to look for tropicbirds, white terns, frigatebirds, noddies, and boobies.​ INCLUDED EXPEDITIONS: ​Zodiac® Cruise Snorkeling​ Landing Ashore (only if conditions permit) Day 9-10: At Sea At Sea October 24-25, 2026 Arrives: 12:00 AM Departs: 11:59 PM Day 11-12: Easter Island, Chile Easter Island, Chile October 26-27, 2026 Arrives: 07:00 AM Departs: 06:00 PM Located in the southeastern Pacific Ocean, Easter Island is a remote Polynesian paradise that offers a truly unique and awe-inspiring experience. Famous for its enigmatic Moai statues, this Chilean territory boasts a rich history and cultural significance. Explore the mysterious archaeological sites, marvel at the colossal stone sculptures, and delve into the stories and legends that surround this extraordinary destination..
