Designed for travellers who appreciate flexibility but still value the camaraderie of a small group, it offers a carefully balanced experience — blending independent exploration with the comfort of travelling together with others for some sections of the trip. Unlike traditional tours with a set itinerary and full-time guide, this journey follows a semi-independent format and does not include a guide or tour leader. You have a set itinerary that you follow independently, however, for some parts of the journey, you’ll share a premium mini-coach with a small group of 2-10 fellow travellers, who are also following the same thoughtfully curated route through Norway’s most spectacular landscapes between Oslo and Bergen. Some days, you’ll travel together, taking in breathtaking scenery and enjoying the insight of a local driver (who is not an official guide!). Other days, you can explore independently based on what you have chosen for that day. In the evenings, you’ll stay in the same high-quality accommodation, where there’s an opportunity to connect with fellow travellers — should you want to — before setting off on your next independent or shared experience. This model offers the best of both worlds: A degree of independence combined with easy opportunities for socialising with fellow travellers and the safety and security of familiar people and a well-planned itinerary. This trip runs weekly from May to September with fixed departures from Oslo every Saturday. The journey can also run in reverse starting from Bergen every Monday during the same period.

Make your own way to your centrally located hotel in the heart of Oslo, an easy direct express train ride away from the airport. The Norwegian capital has a great deal to offer for the observant traveller. We can recommend a walk around the centre of town to view the Parliament, the Castle, and the Harbour area. Discover the new area of Bjorvika with the new Opera House and Munch Museum and then explore the charming shopping streets, cosy cafés and exciting eateries of Grünerløkka. After going shopping at numerous design boutiques, vintage shops and flea markets, head to the Mathallen food hall for local specialties. Lastly, visit the new National Museum of Norway down by the harbour before finding a spot in one of the local fish restaurants for dinner. Day 2: Train to Lillehammer Board your train at the Oslo Central Station and head towards Lillehammer, the small town that rose to international fame when it hosted the Winter Olympics in 1994. Check into your central hotel. Spend the day at your leisure: Sunday is a quiet day in Lillehammer, however the main attractions are open. We recommend a visit to the open-air museum Maihaugen, the Norwegian Olympic Museum, and do not miss the impressive Garmo Stave Church. (B) Day 3: Lom Join the mini-coach to Lom, a 3-hour scenic drive from Lillehammer. This bus trip takes you through some of Norway’s most beautiful highlands and lush valleys. Experience the valley of Gudbrandsdalen surrounded by the national parks, an abundance of locally produced food, old architecture, and good hiking. Lom is a small town encapsulating the very essence of the Norwegian countryside. Situated in the famous Jotunheimen National Park, Lom is surrounded by majestic nature. Check into your charming historic hotel and then browse design shops, local cafes and galleries. Be sure to cross the river and wander around the famous Lom Stave Church, constructed in Norman-style in 1170. It still operates as the local church today so opening hours vary. Dinner is included this evening. (B,D) Day 4: Day trip to Geiranger Day trip to Geiranger, which is 1.5 hours’ drive away from Lom. On arrival, join a fjord rib boat cruise and experience the Geirangerfjord UNESCO World Heritage site. The scenery here is absolutely breathtaking. Take a closer look at the “Seven Sisters”, “Bridal Veil” and “Suitor” waterfalls, the majestic fjord cliffs and abandoned mountain farms. Perhaps you’ll be lucky enough to see porpoises playing in the fjord. You will then have some free time for lunch. Travelling back from Geiranger, the mini-coach will stop at Dalsnibba look out, if there is time available. Please note that the Geirangerfjord visit is subject to change due to weather and snow conditions. The mountain road from Lom to Geiranger normally opens from end of May. Alternatively, have a day to yourself in Lom. We suggest visiting Brimi Bue, a popular Lom hot-spot for fresh local produce and traditional Nordic flavours, owned by renowned chef Arne Brimi -the lunch time slot has good value options to try. Indulge yourselves in the historic atmosphere of Lom open-air museum and its houses dating from the early 1600s and experience the old farmer culture. The Norwegian Mountain Centre is also worth a visit. (B,D) Day 5: Norwegian Fjords Depart Lom for another scenic journey through the spectacular mountain and fjord country of Breheimen and Jostedalsheimen. Stops along the way can change depending on the times and weather conditions. Sognefjellshytta (approx. 1 hr drive) can be one of the coffee/tea breaks, and the cubist stone art work at Mefjellet. A final stop before descending down the mountain is Oscarshaug – another fantastic spot for photos and great views. Enjoy a relaxing lunch along the way before driving over the beautiful Aurlandsfjellet mountain road. End the trip with a stop at the amazing Stegastein viewpoint before reaching the peaceful village of Aurland. (B,L) Day 6: Aurland Spend your day relaxing, hiking and taking in the views in the peaceful little town of Aurland. Enjoy the harbour area with unspoilt views of the fjord and surrounding gardens. If the weather is warm, you can swim in the fjord. We can book optional visits to local mountain farms, guided hikes, kayaking or a fjord safari. These can be pre-booked at an additional cost. (B) Day 7: Aurland - Flåm Transfer from Aurland to Flåm, and step aboard the world famous Flåm Railway to Myrdal Station with several stunning lookout points along the way. Thanks to its steep incline (from sea level to almost 900 meters above sea level in a short hour), the train-ride is rated as one of Europe’s best rail journeys and has become a real highlight for visitors in Norway. Return to Flåm to board the express ferry to Bergen. Take in the fresh air on Norway’s longest fjord, the Sognefjord, during this 5-hour ferry-ride towards Bergen. Check into your centrally located hotel at the end of the day - arriving approximately 8pm. (B) Day 8: Depart Bergen This trip concludes after breakfast. If possible, we recommend spending the day in Bergen exploring the sights or extending with another night. (B) Take a ride on the steep Flåm Railway full of hairpin turns Visit the stunning Geiranger fjord Visit Northern Europe's highest and arguably the most striking mountain pass, Sognefjellet Discover Bryggen, the old Hanseatic wharf in Bergen, and take the funicular to the top of Mt Fløien.
