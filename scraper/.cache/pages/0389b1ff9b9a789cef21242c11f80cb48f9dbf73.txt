Itinerary Day 1-2 Livingstone Meet your guides at 2pm for a pre-departure meeting on day one. Victoria Falls is one of the natural wonders of the world and we take 2 days to explore this area. A visit to Victoria Falls is included and there is time for you to explore or book any of the numerous optional activities at your own expense. Day 3-4 Caprivi Crossing out of Zambia into the Caprivi strip, we spend two days travelling west through this game rich area. We’ll explore the Kwando River by boat and a game drive into the Mahango Game Reserve. Day 5 Rundu After a morning enjoying the abundant birdlife that surrounds the camp, our road takes us along the Kavango River. Villages of grass huts and local wooden crafts and carvings a common sight. We stop for the night at our riverside lodge in Rundu and enjoy a spectacular sunset. Day 6, 7, 8 Etosha National Park We head deeper into Namibia to the Etosha National Park. The National Park surrounds the Etosha Pan and is locally named “the great white place of dry water”. Waterholes surround the pan and attract game. Etosha is known for great sightings of elephant, antelope and lions. Our lodge lies on the boundary of the park, and we spend our mornings and afternoons on game drives. Day 9 Brandberg Our journey covers some beautiful desert landscapes as we move south towards the Brandberg Mountain. Our lodge is situated in the dry Ugab River which is home to the rare desert elephants. We take a walk with a local guide to view the famous White Lady rock painting in the area. Day 10-11 Swakopmund We cross flat open plains to the coast where we visit the Cape Cross seal colony. Further south is the coastal town of Swakopmund where we have a day free to explore the town or try sea kayaking or dune boarding (own expense). German colonial influences are strong in the town of Swakopmund as is reflected in the restaurant menus and the architecture. Day 12-13 Namib Desert The lunar landscapes surround the town of Swakopmund, and we visit these as we leave and head into the Namib Desert with its towering red sand dunes. We will walk to Sossusvlei, explore Sesriem Canyon. Day 14 Windhoek Windhoek is the capital and largest city in Namibia, its charm lies in its harmonious blend of African and European cultures and the friendliness of its people, and an interesting mix of modern and German colonial era influenced architecture. Day 15 Kalahari Crossing into Botswana we overnight in the heart of the Kalahari. We take a walk with the local San Bushmen to learn fascinating bush skills and get an insight into how these incredible people survive in this desert environment. Our overnight lodge is owned and operated by the community. Day 16, 17, 18 Okavango Delta An annual flood of fresh-water spreads into the Kalahari Desert creating the reed lined channels of the Okavango Delta. Our first night is spent in Maun in preparation before journeying deep into the delta on mekoro (dugouts) - an experience not to be missed. We have 2 nights in our tented camp on a remote island and enjoy game walks, swimming and the birdlife in this pristine wilderness area. Day 19 Makigadikgadi Pans Feel the vastness of Africa under a big sky sunset. After the rains, the pans fill with water and attract thousands of water birds and herds of zebra, wildebeest and springbok. Day 20 Chobe National Park We turn north through the Chobe Forest Reserve to Kasane where we settle into our tented lodge right on the river. Chobe NP is famous for large herds of elephant and buffalo. Our afternoon is spent on an exciting wildlife boat cruise in the Chobe NP. Day 21 Livingstone This morning, we transfer across the Zambezi River to Livingstone where the tour ends at +/-12:00 noon.
