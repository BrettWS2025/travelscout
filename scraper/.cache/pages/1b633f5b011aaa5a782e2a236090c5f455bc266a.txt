Raised in a family that prioritised travel, I inherited a passion for all things travel. I have lived in different countries (London, USA, Argentina) and I am fascinated with the rich tapestry of culture, people, religion and food in new places. My love for travel has taken me to some of the world’s most amazing places! From Mauritius to Bahamas and all in between, I have been privileged to experience the world and being able to speak and understand 5 languages English, Afrikaans, Dutch, German and Greek) certainly comes in helpful. I have grown up in South Africa, spending most of my adult life there, being able to show my clients what makes this region so unique is a privilege. Africa was my backyard after all and even after living in NZ for almost 12 years, my heart still beats to the African Drum. For me, choosing a favourite destination is impossible. But .. Bali has literally captivated my heart, and even though I have been there 20+ times, I still always find new things to uncover. As does the Maldives, Mauritius and Seychelles, these islands just have the “it” factor I also love ocean cruising, especially Mediterranean and the Caribbean. Cruising offers such a great variety and a chance to see multiple destinations and experiencing iconic landmarks and locations from your hotel on the sea.
