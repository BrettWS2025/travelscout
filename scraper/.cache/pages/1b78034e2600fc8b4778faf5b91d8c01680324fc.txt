But tonight, you'll meet your fellow travellers before having the chance to explore everything there is to offer. Day 2 - Buenos Aires Now's your opportunity to get the full Porteno (locals from Buenos Aires) experience. This morning why not go check out the colorful La Boca neighbourhood? Tonight we're heading to a tango show. Have a go yourself, enjoy the first of the Argentine food you're sure to love, and then watch the pros show you how it's done. Day 3 - Buenos Aires Today you've got the opportunity to take a day trip to Tigre. Learn about the history and culture of the inhabitants of the "isleños". If you're more comfortable out on the water, opt to experience the Tigre Delta for the day on a relaxing boat ride, or if you want to stay on dry land enjoy a short bike ride around the surrounding areas. No matter what you choose, we'll all dive into a delicious regional lunch. Weather permitting you can even swim and kayak. If you'd prefer to stay the other side of the border, Buenos Aires is yours to explore today, your way. Day 4 - Buenos Aires Now that you know Buenos Aires like a Porteño the day is yours to explore! Join in a day at the Polo where you'll learn about the traditional Argentine game, learn how to play and even partake in a game of your own. In love with the city life? Then spend some time exploring the museums and/or the shops in Palermo. There truly is something for everyone. Day 5 - Buenos Aires to Iguassu Falls Landing in Puerto Iguazu we’ll hop over the border and dig our toes into Brazilian soil for the first time, clapping eyes on yet another astounding natural wonder. Listen out for all those oohhs and aahhs. A collection of 275 individual waterfalls, Iguassu Falls sprawls both Brazil and Argentina, with both sides offering up stunning UNESCO World Heritage parks and views. Today though, is all about the Brazilian side, and what better way to see the falls from every angle than with an optional helicopter ride, taking the term ‘birds eye view’ to a whole new level. Go on – treat yo’ self! For those keeping feet on the ground, take your time exploring the Parque Nacional do Iguaçu. Tonight, dinners packing a serious punch – we’ll be treating you to an authentic Brazilian BBQ dinner. Say hello to the meat sweats… Day 6 - Iguassu Falls Iguassu we’re not done with you yet! Yesterday was all about the Brazilian side, but today we’re hopping back over to Argentina to see what the deal is from this side of the falls. We’ll take a hike to the very edge of Devil’s Throat, the highest of the 275 falls, and for those keen there’s even the option to take to the water with a speed boat ride through the spray of the falls. Refreshing? Oh you could say that…With a full day spent here, take your time exploring, trying to figure out the age old debate – which side wears it better? Day 7 - Iguassu Falls to Rio De Janeiro Catch you later Iguassu – Rio, we’re coming in hot...If Rio knows one thing, it’s how to p-a-r-t-y, so having fun in this life loving city is already a given. But first things first – let’s get acquainted with our surroundings a little better. After a quick orientation tour, the afternoon is then yours to explore as you please, though given our hotel's beachfront location, we reckon you'll only have one thing on your mind. Day 8 - Rio De Janeiro Today check out the city from above, hang gliding to see Rio in all its scenic glory. Then this afternoon is all yours, and it sounds like Copacabana Beach is calling your name. Or if a game's in town watch the masters of football do it like no one else can, while you soak in the crazy atmosphere that goes alongside the national sport. Day 9 - Rio De Janeiro Excuse us while we cry into our caipirinhas - today is our last full day on trip. But before the emotions run too high, let's make sure we see it out with a bang, Rio style. First up is a visit to Christ the Redeemer, a New Wonder of the World. Standing at an impressive 30m high (98ft), this religious monument casts an almighty shadow over the city below, and will be a moment you won't be forgetting anytime soon. This afternoon, how does a boat cruise sound? Featuring cocktails, tunes and good times, it'd be rude not to. Afterwards, we'll enjoy an included farewell dinner together. Day 10 - End Rio De Janeiro This morning, this adventure of epic proportion will finally come to an end. Hug it out with the new friends you now class as family, and damn right you’re already on those reunion tour plans. Europe next summer, anyone?
