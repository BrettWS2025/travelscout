The city was the capital of the Nabateans who dominated the lands of Jordan during pre-Roman times. They carved this wonderland of temples, tombs and elaborate buildings out of solid rock. For centuries, Petra fell into the mists of legend, its existence a guarded secret known only to the local Bedouins and Arab tradesmen.
