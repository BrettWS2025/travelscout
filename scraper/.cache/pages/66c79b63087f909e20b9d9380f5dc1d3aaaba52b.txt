Show more Day 1 Arrive Rome Take time to embrace the Italian passion for life on this grand adventure that starts and ends in the 'Eternal City' of Rome. You'll see reminders of an ancient world, a holy empire and the Renaissance around every turn should you wish to spend the day exploring on your own, after checking in to your hotel. Meet your Travel Director and fellow travellers for a glimpse of what's in store. You could continue your independent exploration of Rome later this evening or join your travel group for a Choice Experience featuring typical Italian cuisine with music. Day 2 Rome Sightseeing and Free Time Your Local Guide will reveal the treasures and main attractions of Rome. Continue your guided sightseeing tour across the Tiber River to Ancient Rome and imagine a time when soldiers and senators built a city that became the centre of the world. The foundations of that city still stand today as a tribute to its former might and you'll have the opportunity to view its iconic ancient ruins before spending time on your own exploring or joining your fellow travellers on a Choice Experience to discover Rome's beautiful piazzas. Day 3 Rome - Bay of Naples Today, the Bay of Naples beckons and you head south past the Abbey of Monte Cassino, the site of fierce battles during World War II. Perhaps spend the afternoon taking a Choice Experience drive along the picture-perfect Amalfi Coast, with a visit to the artistic hub of Positano and its pastel-hued houses that seem to tumble into the Tyrrhenian Sea, or else spend the rest of your day in search of the best Margherita pizza. Its ingredients reflect the red, white and green of Italy's flag – could there be anything more patriotic? Day 4 Sorrento Excursion Today you'll take a scenic journey along the craggy Mediterranean coast, tracing the footsteps of artists, writers and high society who have long revered the sweet shores of Sorrento. Centuries on, there are no signs of the hypnotic sirens that once tempted soldiers to run their ships into the deadly rocks. Instead, fresh scents of citrus are likely to accompany your every step as you explore this beautiful resort town with plenty of time to explore on your own. Perhaps you'll choose to join a Choice Experience to see the excavations of Pompeii in the shadow of Mount Vesuvius. Don't leave the town's historic harbour without sampling some local specialities. Perhaps say salute to a swift and zesty limoncello – it's the perfect after-dinner digestivo. Day 5 Bay of Naples - Assisi Wind your way through Umbria’s rolling hills to the town of Assisi, home of St. Francis. Your Travel Director will show you around this hilltop spot, including the basilica where the beloved saint, known for his simple, joyful way of life, now rests. Day 6 Assisi - Venice (Oriago) Today we cross the dramatic Apennine Mountains bound for the charismatic calle of Venice, once a maritime powerhouse whose influences can be found all across the Eastern Mediterranean. The winged lion remains an enduring symbol of Venice, and is an image you'll see often as you explore the city over the next few days. You will arrive just in time for a Choice Experience gondola ride and Grand Canal cruise – grand palazzi, churches and ornate bridges lining your journey. Day 7 Venice Orientation and Free Time We take to the waters of the lagoon and cruise by private launch to St. Mark's Square, the gateway to the city. Admire the ornate Doge's Palace, the Basilica of St. Mark and the Bridge of Sighs, whose bittersweet views once elicited sighs from prisoners who were unlikely to see their beloved city ever again. There's time on your own to explore before we visit a glassblowing workshop to see the talents of master craftsmen at work at a MAKE TRAVEL MATTER® Experience. This afternoon, perhaps join a Choice Experience to the vibrant rainbow-coloured facades of Burano Island, beacons for resident fishermen seeking a safe journey home across the lagoon. Day 8 Venice - Verona - Lugano - Milan (Sesto San Giovanni) From Roman ruins to Romeo and Juliet, Verona certainly is the stuff of legends. Our first stop today is the city that served as the backdrop for Shakespeare's famous love story and you'll have an opportunity to view the very balcony where the fictional Juliet once called for her Romeo. Admire the Roman Arena where thrilling performances are held to this day, then continue across the Swiss border to visit the pretty lakeside resort of Lugano in Switzerland. Return to Italy this evening. Day 9 Free Day in Milan You have the whole day free to relax. Perhaps lace up your walking shoes for a stroll or simply people-watch with an Aperol Spritz in hand. Alternatively, consider a Choice Experience to discover the Treasures of Milan and explore Lake Como. Day 10 Milan - Pisa - Florence (Prato) You’ve always wanted to see the Leaning Tower of Pisa and now you’re here! We’ll take you to snap a few strategic photos featuring you and the famous leaning tower, then there's time to admire Pisa's Romanesque Square of Miracles in all its marble glory. The structures here are said to symbolise the three main stages of human life – the Baptistery (birth), the Cathedral (life) and the Camposanto (death). Then continue towards Florence, the birthplace of the Renaissance. For a taste of Tuscany, consider joining a Choice Experience in the Tuscan countryside with regional favourites, live music and a glass or two of delicious Chianti. Day 11 Florence Sightseeing and Free Time No expense was spared enriching the city of Florence through art and architecture and you'll see first-hand how this city paved its way to the modern age. Join a Local Specialist this morning for a fascinating account of Florentine history during a walking tour of its historic centre, including views of the Ponte Vecchio, the Cathedral of Santa Maria del Fiore, Giotto's Bell Tower and the Baptistery. Visit Piazza della Signoria, the city's main square where many political and artistic treasures can be seen, then browse the centuries-old trades of gold and leathercraft. This afternoon, perhaps head up to Piazzale Michelangelo and admire the views over Florence's iconic skyline. You may also choose a Choice Experience to see Michelangelo’s David at the Accademia, explore Palazzo Vecchio, or visit the towers and streets of medieval San Gimignano. Day 12 Florence - Siena - Rome Siena's fortified walls, towers and palaces emerge from the rolling countryside on your journey through the beautiful Chianti region. This former economic and military power today hosts the Palio horse race, injecting a shot of colour amidst the burnt sienna facades of the city's Il Campo. Your visit will reveal the city's rich heritage, architecture and cuisine, most notably why Siena is renowned for its signature panforte fruit cake, which you have to sample during a visit to a pasticceria. Leaving Tuscany behind, we return to Rome for one final encounter with the Eternal City. Or join your fellow travellers for a Choice Experience dinner to end your holiday on a high note. Day 13 Depart Rome The Italian dream of eating well, laughing often and loving much will linger long after your Splendours of Italy tour comes to an end this morning. Say a fond arrivederci to your travel companions and Travel Director, reminiscing over epic shared memories along these unforgettable 13 days in Italy.
