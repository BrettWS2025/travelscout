Meet our Cook Islands specialists See all See all Suzanne Andrews House of Travel Palmerston North: The Square I've travelled extensively all over the world and I now want to make your travel dreams come true! I've worked in the travel industry for many years and I now want to share my experience and passion for travelling with you. Suzanne Jason McKay House of Travel Nelson As the proud Owner Operator of House of Travel Nelson, I lead a small but passionate team dedicated to taking care of all your travel needs. I primarily work on the Orbit World Travel side of our business, specialising in business and group travel. But as a traveller myself, I love chatting with customers and the team about their upcoming adventures — there’s nothing better than sharing in the excitement of a great trip! Travel has played a huge role in my life. From years of family holidays to the Gold Coast and Fiji, where the kids spent hours in the pool or on the playground, to unforgettable highlights like Disneyland (they were 10 and 12 — the perfect age!), followed by a relaxing week in Mexico. These days, with older kids, we’re seeking more adventure. Our recent trip to Vietnam was a standout — from the vibrant energy of Ho Chi Minh City to the peaceful beauty of Hoi An's lanterns and Halong Bay. If you haven’t been, it’s a must! Next on my list? Europe. While I’ve done a couple of quick trips in the past, I’m keen to take the time to explore the diverse cultures and rich history of the places I’ve spent years helping others discover. Whether your trip is big or small, come in and see us at House of Travel Nelson — we’ll make sure it’s your best one yet. Jason Toni Rendell House of Travel Rotorua As a 17 year old, I headed off to Finland on a student exchange for a year, my first ever overseas trip and the start of my passion for travel. Whether it’s a quick jaunt across the Tasman, an adventure through Vietnam or a guided coach tour of Europe, I love working with you to create the perfect holiday. Having been in the industry for over 30 years, I have an extensive knowledge of airfares, and travel providers, I combine that with the knowledge of my returning customers and the wisdom of the House of Travel collective to craft your travel. There sure is a lot you need to know and I pride myself on keeping up to date with industry trends and changes. That may be new destinations to visit, beautiful places to stay or changes in travel requirements. So get in touch and let me help make your travel dreams come true. Toni Angela Taverner House of Travel Hamilton City With over 40 years of travel experience, including 30 years living and working in the USA, I’ve developed a deep passion for showcasing the beauty and diversity of the United States. But my love of travel goes far beyond that. Travel is not just a career for me—it's a lifelong journey that has shaped my understanding of the world and its many cultures. I thrive on helping my clients discover unique, off-the-beaten-path destinations, and I have a special fondness for authentic, remote locations that offer a genuine connection to the culture and landscape. My adventures have taken me to the vast sands of Morocco and Egypt, where I’ve explored ancient ruins and vibrant markets. I’ve trekked the Inca Trail in Peru and hiked to Everest Base Camp in Nepal, experiencing firsthand the stunning landscapes and welcoming communities. Whether it’s trekking through the mountains of Nepal or uncovering hidden gems in Peru, I love guiding travellers to places that offer more than just sightseeing—they offer a chance to truly connect with the world. I find great joy in helping my clients turn their dream holidays into reality, whether they’re after iconic landmarks or remote locations that are rich in culture and adventure. Through my work as a travel agent, I create experiences that go beyond the ordinary, helping travellers discover not only new places but new perspectives. Let me help you craft a journey that will stay with you long after you’ve returned home. Angela Best. Holidays. Ever! Inspired to travel to Fiji?
