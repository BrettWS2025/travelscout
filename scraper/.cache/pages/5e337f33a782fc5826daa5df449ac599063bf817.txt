Itinerary Day 1-2: Papeete, French Polynesia Embark your ship and enjoy an overnight stay in Papeete, the vibrant capital of Tahiti. As the largest of French Polynesia’s 118 islands and atolls, Tahiti is a stunning blend of volcanic peaks and lush landscapes. Papeete serves as the heart of the region, home to government offices, banks, hospitals, and essential services, while also welcoming visitors seeking an unforgettable island experience. Day 3: Moorea, French Polynesia Moorea, often likened to James Michener's mythical island of Bali Hai, is only 11 miles from Tahiti. Many visitors say it is worth the visit just to see Moorea's spectacular bays. The volcanic peaks, reflected in the waters of Cook's Bay and Opunohu Bay, rise like a shark's jaw from the island's base. Sharks sighting on nearly every dive makes this island a popular diving destination. At times a tuna will come by or dolphins will be heard clicking just out of sight. Day 4: Cruising the South Pacific Spend a day at Sea and experience all your Regent Seven Seas ship has to offer. Day 5: Rarotonga, Cook Islands Rarotonga, the capital of the scattered nation of the Cook Islands, is a relaxing place of beauty and style. Its small population lives on the coast of the circular island, while the interior is lush, rugged, and jungle-clad, offering the opportunity for challenging walks and sensational views. A former New Zealand colony, it has the distinct feel of a New Zealand Polynesian outpost, including New Zealand newspapers and television-as well as the distinctive accent. Day 6: Cruising the South Pacific Spend a day at Sea and experience all your Regent Seven Seas ship has to offer. Day 7: Rangiroa, French Polynesia Rangiroa is the largest atoll of the Tuamotu Archipelago, which comprises 78 coral atolls scattered over several hundred miles of the eastern Pacific Ocean. Life on these remote atolls is simple, quiet and peaceful. In the small villages, the visitor can discover the true flavor of the Tuamotu, often participating in the daily activities of the Paumotu people. The interior lagoons are a haven for black pearl farms, fish breeding farms, snorkeling and scuba diving. Day 8: Huahine, French Polynesia One of the most picturesque and geographically diverse islands in the Society Group, Enclosed in a single lagoon, it covers 75 square miles. Huahine is located 109 miles northwest of Papeete. The highest point on the island, Mt. Turi, reaches 2,200 feet and is located on Huahine Nui. Mt. Tavaiura in the Fitii Peninsula looks like a women's face, leading to her chest and her round belly, hence one of the interpretation for Huahine's original name (pregnant woman). Day 9-10: Bora Bora, French Polynesia Bora Bora lies 150 miles northwest of Tahiti in the Society Islands. The main island, home to 4,225 inhabitants, is in the center of a multicolored lagoon, surrounded by offshore "motu" islets inside a protective coral necklace. Its lagoon is world-famous for its beauty. A partially paved road circles the island, passing colorful villages, archeological sites, and old Army bunkers and cannons left over from WWII, when 5,000 American GIs made a "friendly invasion." Day 11: Raiatea, French Polynesia Raiatea and Taha'a are two separate islands sharing the same lagoon. Located 120 miles northwest of Tahiti, between Huahine and Bora Bora among the leeward Society Islands, Raiatea is the second largest island of French Polynesia after Tahiti. The island tour reveals lush green valleys, numerous waterfalls, and pineapple and vanilla plantations. Discover fascinating under-water scenery within Raiatea's deep lagoon, rich with fish and surrounded by mountains.
