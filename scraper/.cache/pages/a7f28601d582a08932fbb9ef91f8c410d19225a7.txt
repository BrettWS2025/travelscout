From unforgettable dining experiences and close-up wildlife encounters to serene hideaways nestled in charming coastal towns, Queensland’s shoreline is a treasure trove waiting to be explored. For those eager to dive into adventure, here’s a 7-day itinerary through the breathtaking Southern Great Barrier Reef - from the beach to the bush and back again. View more View less 6 night suggested self-drive & sightseeing activities EXPERIENCE THE UNEXPECTED Enquire now SUGGESTED ITINERARY Day 1: Arrive into Bundaberg Start your Southern Great Barrier Reef adventure in Bundaberg. Arrive in the morning and collect your hire car, Next, immerse yourself in the rich culture of the Taribelang Bunda people with a Taribelang Bunda Cultural Tour - a powerful Indigenous experience unique to Bundaberg, sharing stories and traditions from over 60,000 years of connection to Country. For lunch, choose between The Orchard Table, nestled in a macadamia grove, or The Garden Mill, surrounded by lush gardens and friendly farm animals. Then, dive into the region’s iconic flavours with a guided tour of the Bundaberg Rum Distillery - a fascinating look at how a surplus of molasses sparked a world-renowned brand (plus a few cheeky tastings!). As evening approaches, head to the Mon Repos Turtle Centre to learn about the incredible life cycle of marine turtles. Join a ranger-led beach tour to witness nesting turtles or help guide hatchlings to the sea - an unforgettable experience. Be sure to pre-book your tickets. Wrap up your day with a stay at The Point Resort in Bargara, offering beachfront views. Day 2: Bundaberg Start your day with an unforgettable adventure to the Southern Great Barrier Reef. Board a luxury catamaran with Lady Musgrave Island Experience and spend 4.5 hours immersed in reef magic - snorkelling in crystal-clear waters, swimming alongside turtles, and spotting vibrant marine life among the coral gardens. Join a guided island tour to learn about Lady Musgrave’s unique ecosystem, or gaze into the reef world below from the glass-bottom boat. A delicious lunch onboard rounds out this sun-soaked reef escape. Back on land, treat yourself to a meal at Water St Kitchen, where traditional cooking meets modern creativity. This small but passionate team champions local producers, crafting dishes that celebrate the region’s finest ingredients. Their “bare to the bone” approach honours culinary craftsmanship, pairing each plate with exceptional Australian wines and fine champagne for a truly memorable dining experience. Day 3: Agnes Waters Hit the road from Bundaberg to Agnes Water—a scenic 90-minute drive dotted with roadside stalls selling fresh local produce, perfect for a quick snack stop. Once you arrive, head to 1770 Getaway for brunch at the Garden Café, tucked into a lush tropical oasis. With its relaxed vibe, flavour-packed menu, great coffee, and irresistible cake cabinet, it’s the perfect way to ease into your coastal escape. After brunch, take a short drive to the enchanting Paperbark Forest Walk. Spritz on some bug spray and follow the trail through a magical landscape of towering paperbarks, wooden boardwalks, and stepping stones. It’s a short but unforgettable stroll that feels like stepping into a storybook. Next, cool off with a swim at Agnes Water Beach, or take to the water with a kayak hire from Liquid Adventures. Feeling adventurous? Join a surf lesson with Reef 2 Beach Surf School and ride the waves like a local. When hunger strikes again, settle in for a late lunch at the 1770 Beach Hotel, where sweeping ocean views pair perfectly with fresh local fare and a cold drink. As the day winds down, hop aboard the iconic LARC! amphibious vehicle for a sunset tour. Cruise along the coastline, spot stingrays and turtle nests, and hear fascinating tales of the region’s history as the sun dips below the horizon. Wrap up your day with dinner at The Tree, then unwind at Sandcastles 1770, where a comfy bed awaits just steps from the beach. Day 4: Byfield Begin your morning with the peaceful 1770 Butterfly Walk, starting at the Captain Cook Monument and winding gently along the coastline. This easy 15–20 minute stroll is especially magical from March to June, when thousands of Blue Tiger Butterflies fill the air. After your walk, cool off with a swim before hitting the road for the 2.5-hour drive to the Capricorn Coast. On the way, pass through Rockhampton, waving to the iconic bull statues scattered around town. Stop for lunch at Headricks Lane, a stylish and welcoming spot where you can share small plates like buttermilk fried chicken, sticky beef short ribs, and braised lamb tacos—or go solo with their signature wagyu cheeseburger. Continue your journey through the Queensland bush to Byfield, a peaceful escape where the world feels far away. Unplug with a bushwalk, explore the forest by bike, or simply relax and breathe in the fresh air. Choose from unique stays like Castle Rock Farm, an off-grid retreat surrounded by nature, or opt for a day pass or overnight stay at Ferns Hideaway, where you can kayak, swim, and explore at your own pace. As the day winds down, settle in for a restful night, with the sounds of the bush and a crackling fire setting the perfect scene for relaxation. Day 5 : Yeppoon Ease into the day with a tranquil paddle along Waterpark Creek, where towering trees stretch over glassy waters and mirror-like reflections dance with shades of blue and soft clouds. The only sounds are the gentle splash of your paddle and the calls of native birds echoing through the forest. After your kayak, begin the journey toward Yeppoon, with a few charming stops along the way. Grab a coffee and a freshly baked scone with jam and cream at the Byfield General Store, then drop by Nob Creek Pottery to admire the work of renowned ceramic artists Steve Bishopric and Sue McBurnie. Their studio is filled with beautiful pottery, jewellery, and artwork. Next, swing by Cooberrie Park Wildlife Sanctuary, where you can meet sugar gliders, snap a selfie with a kangaroo, and learn about the sanctuary’s efforts to rehabilitate native wildlife. Once in Yeppoon, start your exploration with a coffee and treat at Lure Living, then wander through the town to discover vibrant street art hidden in the multi-storey carpark or enjoy a peaceful stroll along the beach. As the sun sets, head to Vue Wine Bar & Restaurant for a glass of wine and a delicious dinner - don’t skip the fried cheese! Then retreat to your ocean-view room at Salt, perched on the hilltop, where you can unwind and soak in the coastal serenity. Day 6: Great Keppel Island Start your day with a visit to Flour, where the aroma alone will have your mouth watering. Indulge in their signature smashed potatoes or pumpkin fritters, topped with gooey poached eggs and creamy hollandaise. Pair it with a perfectly brewed coffee - and don’t forget to grab a slice (or three) of cake to-go. Next, catch the morning ferry to Great Keppel Island and check in to your beachfront cabin at Great Keppel Island Hideaway. Spend the day exploring the island’s natural beauty - whether it’s bushwalking through rugged trails or joining a glass-bottom boat and snorkel tour with Freedom Fast Cats. Discover the vibrant reef at Monkey Beach, a protected green zone teeming with colourful fish and unique coral formations. For a dose of adrenaline, try water-skiing, stand-up paddleboarding, or a guided jet ski safari, all while learning about the island’s fascinating marine environment. Back at the Hideaway, enjoy fresh seafood for lunch and dinner at the bar and bistro, then find your perfect patch of sand to watch the sun dip below the horizon in a blaze of orange and pink. As night falls, retreat to your cabin and drift off to the soothing sound of waves lapping the shore. Day 7: Depart Rockhampton After breakfast, it’s time to return to the mainland. Board the morning ferry and enjoy the peaceful ride back. Once ashore, grab a coffee from The Waterline Restaurant at the marina before making your way to Emu Park. Here, take a moment to explore the Singing Ship and the Centenary of ANZAC Memorial Walk - a beautifully designed tribute to the ANZACs. The trail offers sweeping coastal views and moving stories that honour the courage and sacrifice of those who served. Lest we forget. When it’s time to head home, drive back to Rockhampton Airport to catch your flight - your heart full of joy, your mind brimming with memories, and your belly still smiling from all the incredible food and experiences shared along the Southern Great Barrier Reef. Lady Musgrave Island is where reef dreams come true. From the moment you arrive, you're surrounded by crystal-clear waters, vibrant coral gardens, and an abundance of marine life. Whether you're snorkelling with turtles, exploring the island’s unique ecosystem, or simply soaking up the sunshine on the pontoon, every moment feels like magic. Mon Repos Turtle Centre is where conservation comes to life. From witnessing nesting turtles under the stars to helping tiny hatchlings find their way to the sea, every visit is a powerful, hands-on experience. It’s a rare chance to connect with nature, learn about marine conservation, and be part of something truly special. Bundaberg Rum Distillery than just rum - it’s a story of local ingenuity and iconic Aussie spirit. From its humble beginnings turning excess molasses into gold, to today’s world-class distillery tours and tastings, Bundaberg Rum is a must-visit. Come for the history, stay for the flavour (and maybe a cheeky sample or two!). Our favourite places to stay: The Point Resort, Bargara Sandcastles 1770, Agnes Waters Castle Rock Farm or Ferns Hideaway, Byfield Salt Beachfront Apartments, Yeppoon Great Keppel Island Hideaway Choosing your Rental Car Take into consideration the size of the vehicle you require.
