As the former capital of the ancient Lanna Kingdom, Chiang Mai is culturally very rich and has an abundance of temples and fascinating architecture, which are a fusion of Lanna, Mon, and Burmese styles. Nowadays it is very modern city, similar to Bangkok. Our package has compiled a hand-picked list of Chiang Mai’s highlights that you can choose to your preference and ensure that you have the very best possible experience within three days.

Itinerary Day 1: Arrive Chiang Mai Upon arrival at Chiang Mai Airport, our guide greets you and transports you to your hotel in town. After checking in, there’s time to relax and get settled. Start the day to discover the very best of Chiang Mai, choose one (1) inclusive excursion from below; 1. Half Day City & Temples with Wat Phra That Doi Suthep Explore the beautiful Buddhist temples and their ancient interior which reflects architecture and faith from more than six centuries ago. The notable ones within the city wall are Wat Phra Singh, Wat Chedi Luang and Wat Suandok. The highlight though is Wat Phra That Doi Suthep situated outside of town on the hill of Doi Suthep; it is one of the most sacred temples of nation and houses Lord Buddha’s relicts. 2. Half Day Chiang Mai City Orientation Tour by Tri-shaw Take the iconic trishaw and explore the heart of Chiang Mai from local scrimmaging city life and markets to astonishingly erected temples and buildings offering beautiful traditional interior, which have been built many centuries ago. Witness a ceremony of Monks and experience Buddhism and its customs and rituals. 3. Half Day Local Life Along Ping River by Boat & Samlor What’s the best way to get from A to B? Check out our guide to a selection of the most iconic modes of transport available in Asia. There is no better way to leave the busy city streets behind and relax for a while on the water by a traditional Thai wooden boat, carried along the cool waters of the Ping river. Samlors (three-wheeled bikes) have been used in Thailand for over 60 years. They have evolved greatly during that time and continue to prove to be a very useful mode of transportation. Though motorcycle taxis are becoming more common for quick trips, there’s still nothing like a Samlor for carrying a load or sightseeing in a bit more comfort. 4. Half Day Culinary Delights of Chiang Mai This evening excursion will take one on a guided culinary tour, where you can sample the delights of Chiang Mai cuisine, including various mouthwatering local snacks, and the delicious Khao Soi - a delightful coconut curry noodle dish that is unique to northern part of Thailand. The tour takes place in popular night market where Thai cuisine cooked right in front of you and you gain an insight of the Chiang Mai's culinary history. Day 2: Chiang Mai After breakfast at your hotel, you have a full day of leisure to discover the historic walled city of Chiang Mai on your own, or take an excursion recommended by your guide. We suggest learning about the Asian elephants at one of the elephant sanctuaries. Trekking, biking and cooking classes are popular choices.
