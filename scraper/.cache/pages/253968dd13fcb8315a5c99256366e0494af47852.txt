The journey from the airport to your hotel will take approximately 45 minutes and is an entertaining experience full of chaotic traffic, distinctive architecture and overloaded motorbikes. Ho Chi Minh City, formally Saigon, is a city of bright neon lights, endless shopping and trendy cafes. Its wide tree-lined boulevards reflect its French heritage, and towering skycrapers announce it has landed squarely in the 21st Century. As a contrast to this modern backdrop is the chaotic traffic of swarming motorbikes which are generally overloaded or carrying exotic passengers. This is people watching at its best. At 18.00pm our Vespa team will meet you at your hotel for ‘A foodie night out on the town’. Experience the local nightlife and enjoy tasty food and live music as we ride pillion on vintage Vespas along the busy streets of this vibrant city.

Your expert driver will then zoom through the busy streets of Ho Chi Minh City as you check out some of the famous highlights in this bustling city. Feel like a local as we feast on authentic, fresh seafood dishes, eating streetside and then enjoy the local favourite that is the delicious Banh Xeo, a traditional Vietnamese savoury pancake. We then ride off into the night again to experience live music at a live music venue where a new generation of Vietnamese flaunt their style. Bring a healthy appetite and a sense of adventure as our guides show you their city by night. (D) Day 2: Ho Chi Minh City - Hoi An This morning, at 8.00am a local English speaking guide will meet you at your hotel for your half day tour of Ho Chi Minh City. Explore Ho Chi Minh City by a traditional cyclo, a three-wheeled bicycle with a carriage at the front for you to sit in, while the driver pedals you through Ho Chi Minh City. You will be cycled along the Saigon River and through the old market on Ham Nghi Street where imported food and wine can be found. Next visit, Tao Dan Park - a popular place amongst the locals often to get in a reviving walk, do physical exercises, Tai Chi or to enjoy a relaxing moment. A stop will be made at the Notre Dame Cathedral and the General Post Office, both fine examples of French colonial architecture. Ride to the War Remnants Museum, displaying old military equipment and other related items from the Vietnam War.

Then you will have free time until our driver meets you at your hotel and transfer you to Ho Chi Minh airport for a short flight to Da Nang. Upon arrival in Da Nang, you will be picked up and transferred to your hotel in Hoi An to check in and relax. (B) Day 3: Hoi An This morning you have a Hoi An Highlight & Hidden Gem Half Day by Vespa Tour with lunch at the end.

Your adventure continues as you travel out of town by weaving through a maze of zigzagging back roads and alleys and delving into the beautiful countryside where you can immerse yourself in the exceptional panoramic views of lush green rice paddies and serene waterways. You’ll even have the chance to take an exciting and unforgettable ride in a bamboo basket boat in the water coconut forest, allowing you to experience the natural beauty of Hoi An in a thrilling and unique way.

On arrival, we will explore the cooking school’s herb and vegetable garden, before learning about some of Hoi An’s and Vietnam’s best-known dishes.

Considered as the largest pagoda by its scale and artistic architecture in Danang city, Linh Ung pagoda with the highest statue of Lady Buddha (actually Lady Bodhisattva) in Vietnam created a wonderful place where visitors can free their mind by enjoying boundless ocean, beautiful and lively coastal road. Linh Ung – Bai But pagoda features perfect harmony between the modern and traditional architectures of Vietnamese pagodas, especially in the three-entrance gate, the main chamber and the ancestors’ house.
