Today, it holds the distinctive title of being the southernmost city on Earth, often referred to as "the end of the world." Situated along the banks of the Beagle Channel, Ushuaia unveils itself like an artist's masterpiece. A mosaic of vibrant houses adds a splash of color against the dramatic backdrop of snow-capped mountains. Dominating this breathtaking panorama is Monte Olivia, its jagged peaks soaring 4,530 feet above the landscape. The terrain transforms from dense forests of Southern beech trees at sea level to alpine ecosystems as you ascend. Thanks to its strategic location and proximity to the Antarctic Peninsula, Ushuaia has earned its status as the gateway to the Great White Continent. Yet, Ushuaia is more than just a stepping stone to Antarctica. It's a treasure trove of natural history, indigenous heritage, and the spirit of exploration. From embarking on awe-inspiring treks in the nearby Tierra del Fuego National Park to delving into the rich narratives at "The End of the World" museum, Ushuaia promises a plethora of experiences that cater to the curious and the adventurous alike.

Day 11: Ezeiza International Airport 11 Mar 26 ARRIVE EZE AIRPORT Ezeiza International Airport, the airport for Buenos Aires. Referred to as the "Paris of South America", Buenos Aires is considered as one of the most livable cities in South America. Although the bustling capital city has just under 3,000,000 inhabitants and a population density of 13,680 inhabitants per square kilometer (34,800 per square mile), it was rated in 2018 as one of the top cities on the continent for its ‘quality of life’. Twinned with world cities such as Moscow and Miami, Buenos Aires displays through its architecture, a cultural past rooted in both the Old and New Worlds. A vibrancy for life can be seen everywhere. Crowded public markets, street performers dancing the tango, colorful graffiti-style street art, ultra-modern buildings, a dramatic skyline and a bustling port. Culturally, Buenos Aires has the busiest live theatre industry on Earth, outperforming New York, London and Paris. Every weekend, over 300 theatres are active with plays and productions. Buenos Aires was founded in 1580 by Spanish explorer Juan de Garay, and has changed hands many times during its history.
