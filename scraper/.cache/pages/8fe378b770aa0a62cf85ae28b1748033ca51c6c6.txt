Balancing everything we love about being in Europe. Stunning days spent on the coast of San Sebastian, cultured nights bar hopping in Prague, and enough time in Italy to leave you up to your eyebrows in pizza. Show more Day 1 London to Paris Welcome to the first day of the best holiday of your life - we're calling it early! After a few pleasantries in London we'll get the show on the road with Paris in our sights. A few hours in and your jaws are on the floor already. These chalk cliffs that edge the English coastline are known as the White Cliffs of Dover, the first of many natural beauties we'll see on this trip. After we ferry across the English Channel for France we'll arrive in Calais, where we will take in the history of World War I battlefields in the Valley of the Somme. Kicking off night one, we arrive in none other than the lust-worthy Paris! It's straight down to business with a tour of the city lit up by the lights of night. Day 2 Paris Drool over haute couture you can't afford, admire the Notre Dame Cathedral whilst juggling coffee and crêpes, & get artsy at the Louvre. Just don't wear yourself out, you will probably want to get involved with dinner and a cabaret show. Smitten and it's only day two! Day 3 Paris to Bordeaux Wipe away your tears sad travellers! Paris is not going anywhere, you can always come back and visit her again. You, on the other hand, are going somewhere, and it's somewhere pretty magnificent...Wise folk tell us that wine has been produced in Bordeaux since the 1st Century - that's a long time, which means they know what they're doing. And it's not just the vin that has dragged us here, it's a pretty place to boot featuring its famous Miroir d'eau (water mirror). You'll have the option to sip your way through local wines while soaking up the sights on a scenic stroll - because sightseeing’s better with a glass in hand. Day 4 Bordeaux to San Sebastian Breathe in your last breath of Bordeaux before we hit the road in search of the Spanish border. In just a few short hours we'll be beach side and exploring San Sebastian. Our stop will have you people watching in this cute little town on the French and Spanish border. With two nights in Spain's coastal town of San Sebastian, it will be hard to wipe the smiles off our faces. You're free to explore then you'll have the option to hit up our epic Pintxos tour. Your call, but trust us… the flavours are next level. Day 5 San Sebastian We'll be dropping lots of delicious sounding words today as we explore Parte Vieja, Playa de la Concha and Centro Romántico. Say it again: Romántico! Follow the cobblestone roads & soak up San Sebastian's coastline before we enjoy an included dinner this evening. Day 6 San Sebastian to Barcelona Having settled into life with afternoon siestas, today will only be a departure from San Sebastian, don't worry leaving Spain is not on the agenda. Sigh with relief. This town comes complete with a baroque Basilica, a perfect combination of Islamic and Gothic architecture and truly a sight to behold. Hola Barcelona... the first dose of Mediterranean Sea! That's if you can drag yourself away from the intoxicating city & get to the beach. We'll kick things off with a stop at the epic Sagrada Familia and then you're free to check out the unique gothic architecture, round the clock parties & street life. Just don't tire yourself out - chances are you'll want to partake in the evening of Flamenco fun. Day 7 Barcelona They say this sexy city sizzles and we couldn’t agree more. For a taste of what’s in store, here’s just the beginning of a never-ending list: hit up the colourful wonderland that is Parc Güell, soak up the sun at the beach, then lose yourself in the backstreets with non-stop tapas and paella. Washed down with sangria of course. This afternoon, you’ve got the chance to level up your foodie game with an optional MAKE TRAVEL MATTER® Experience. Roll up your sleeves, cook up a storm, and taste the magic of a meal you made yourself. Trust us - your taste buds will thank you. Day 8 Barcelona to French Riviera As smitten as we are by Barcelona, we have more of Europe to conquer. Much, much more...You're not a real celebrity until you've frolicked on the French Riviera, and who are we to keep you off the A-List? Discover sapphire waters & endless glamour as we roll along this glitzy coastline. We’ll kick back with an included dinner, then the night’s all yours to own. Day 9 French Riviera Missing an opportunity to see this part of the world up close and personal would be criminal. An optional bike ride with the coastline as the backdrop is on the agenda this morning. Speaking of things you shouldn't miss, this region is famous for lavender honey, aioli & rosé wine; all 3 in one meal should be your mission. Please tell us you didn't throw away all of your pennies on perfume today? Because you're going to want a few spare coins tonight so you can play fancy. We're visiting the Monte Carlo Casino & the Royal Palace in Monaco. After a night on the blackjack table it's back to our cosy accommodation and to bed, the next part of the adventure starts tomorrow. Day 10 French Riviera to Pisa via Cinque Terre Having exhausted all our hilarious Nice puns, we'll head south in search of the UNESCO World Heritage site of the Cinque Terre. Welcome to Cinque Terre, the sexiest collection of fishing villages on the planet. Armed with your rail pass, spend the day absorbing the dramatic beauty of this place, but we suggest you get out for a hike, a food crawl, some vino or all of the above. Then we'll head to our home for the night - Pisa. Oh, what a long but beautiful day it has been! We'll check into our hotel and get some well deserved rest. Day 11 Pisa to Florence As if we were going to leave Pisa without a trip to the Leaning Tower. Depriving you of the chance to perfect the holding-up-the-tower shot would be down right criminal.Explore the city's markets complete with gelato in hand; marvel at artworks from the likes of legends like Michelangelo; and be impressed by the skilful art of leather at an included demonstration. These are the sorts of activities likely to fill your Florence agenda. Tonight you can choose to begin your Tuscan love affair at a Free Time Add-On dinner - think antipasti & wine. Day 12 Florence to Sorrento After farewell-ing Florence this morning we will journey along the boot of Italy until we reach the globally adored town of Sorrento for some blissed out coast hangs. "So so so so in love with Sorrento" are about the only words you'll muster up tonight as you sit seaside watching the sunset in this town of beauty. Here, you’ll have the chance to treat yourself with a visit to La Sorgente, a nearby locally-owned family mozzarella farm, for an authentic Italian meal complete with fresh homemade mozzarella, rich olive oil and sunshine-coloured limoncello. Day 13 Sorrento It simply wouldn't be a trip to Sorrento without a side note to...We'll take a scenic drive along the Amalfi coast today, stopping off in Amalfi town to admire the castles and coastal views. Next up, you'll have the unique opportunity to visit a Lemon Farm and learn all about how your fav limoncello is made.Back in Sorrento, we'll stroll along the plunging cliffs, explore the impossibly pretty historical centre and taste some local gnocchi. Day 14 Sorrento to Rome Another glorious Italian day awaits us. Iconic sites and ancient history will keep our jaws at floor level until our heads hit our pillows. After less than an hour gazing lovingly out of our windows at the Amalfi Coast, it will be time for a stop. Here in the ancient city of Pompeii you will have the chance to partake in a guided walking tour taking in Roman city remains. Today's roadtrip beauty is never-ending as we take in the volcanic beauty of Mt. Vesuvius en route to Rome. On arrival in the open time capsule that is Italy's capital, we'll hit the cobblestoned streets to check out some of the most famous sights this city has on offer.
