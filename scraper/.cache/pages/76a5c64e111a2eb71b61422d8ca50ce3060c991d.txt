Your Beach Fale Survival Kit Respect your hosts as you are essentially a guest in their home. As you are totally responsible for your belongings; including your passport, take a lockable bag or padlock. Take a torch as there may not be a reading lamp and it will be handy to guide you to the communal bathroom in the darkness of night. Bring your shoes into your Fale at night so local dogs don't run off with them! Take your own towel for showering and to use at the beach. Take a basic supply of bottled water, beer and snacks away as your hosts may run out of these. With any food supplies keep them well sealed away from any unwanted four-legged visitors at night. If you have food or medical issues, let your hosts know before you arrive. While it's great to be lulled to sleep by the waves, earplugs are a must in case you're unlucky with barking dogs, crowing roosters or partying guests A lavalava (Samoan sarong) is handy to have close by - they not only look good but are cool, handy for lying on the beach and when wrapped, provide instant modesty. Remember above all, pack your sense of adventure and enjoy legendary Samoan hospitality. Terms & Conditions Sales to 21 Nov 25 or until sold out.
