Altogether, this forms a colourful landscape above and under water with a rich variety of flora and fauna. It is also home of the Moken, a traditionally nomadic sea people who have lived in harmony with nature along Thailand’s Andaman coast for thousands of years. More recently, the Moken Experiences have faced challenges of modernization, and are now opened to sharing their way of life with respectful visitors in order to protect their culture. Take a unique private tour of Koh Surin with the original inhabitants of this tropical paradise, the indigenous Moken people. Bask in the natural beauty of the Surin Islands while you immerse in Moken Life and snorkel the crystal waters of the Andaman Sea. Help conserve the Moken’s unique culture by your participation in this private tour with the Moken community.
