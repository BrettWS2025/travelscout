Itinerary Day 1: Rabaul - Kokopo Welcome to Kokopo and Papua New Guinea! This is a land of dense jungle, bright coral reefs and wartime secrets. Your adventure begins with a welcome meeting at 6.30 pm where you’ll meet your group leader and fellow travellers. For those arriving today, you’ll be met at Tokua (Rabaul) Airport for an included transfer to your accommodation. If you do happen to arrive early, why not get out and about and soak up the chilled-out vibe of East New Britain? Wherever you are, you’ll be sure to see the dominating Tarvurvur Volcano looming in the distance. Day 2: Rabaul - Vunagum Village - Kokopo Set off on a historical tour of Rabaul town with your group. There’ll be some walking on uneven surfaces, so pack some good shoes. Today’s tour will include stops at military sites including Yamamoto’s bunker, the Japanese submarine base and the Japanese tunnels, as well as the Rabaul markets and the New Guinea Club, where you’ll gain some insight into life in Rabaul before PNG’s independence and the 1994 devastating volcanic eruption. You'll also spend some time in nearby Vunagum Village today. Learn how to make agir (a traditional coconut stew) from scratch for lunch, explore the peaceful village and maybe even watch a passionate performance from the local church choir. Return to your Kokopo for the evening. Day 3: Duke of York Islands The neighbouring islands all have their own personality, customs and cultures, and today you’ll cruise around a few to explore and experience this for yourself. Your destination today is the Duke of York Islands, but on the way, be sure to keep an eye out for wildlife too, as dolphins and even dugongs are known to play in these crystal-clear waters of the Pacific. A local village will host you while you visit Duke of York and there’ll be opportunities to learn about traditional weaving, cooking and fishing. Head on a tour of the island with your group leader, and then have plenty of time to relax into island time. All that you’ve got to worry about this afternoon is sitting back and enjoying the warm hospitality and magical singing voices of the Duke of York islanders at your overnight homestay. Day 4: Duke of York Islands Rise and shine early for some time out on the water for swimming and snorkelling around the Duke of York Islands. Your leader and boat skipper will find the best place based on tides and weather conditions. Work up an appetite then head back to the village for breakfast and further immersion in local life. Day 5-7: Firedance Festival This morning, head into the highlands of the Gazelle Peninsula. It’s here that the Firedance Festival takes place, and tonight, you’ll enjoy another village homestay. You’ll be welcomed the village with a traditional Melanesian welcome ceremony – a common practice to show the village residents that your group is welcome. After, enjoy a traditional mumu lunch – where root vegetables are wrapped in leaves and cooked under hot stones. Settle into the local feel of the village, then later, the festivities will start. The traditional fire dancing ceremonies are a cultural spectacle for locals and visitors alike, and your expert local guides will be able to explain to you the historical importance of the dance, as well as the costumes and performance. As it goes into the night, villagers add bundles of firewood to the bonfire, and the fire-dancers will perform until their feet put out the last flames. Enjoy a barbecue dinner as you cherish this cultural moment. Over the next 2 days, you will enjoy further performances from local cultural groups that take place across multiple villages. On the final morning, experience a closing party during which the village will farewell their guests. After saying goodbye to your hosts, you’ll make your way back to Kokopo. Day 8: Kokopo Explore historic sites around Kokopo today including the Bitapaka War Cemetery – where soldiers from World War I and II have been laid to rest. Explore the local markets and visit the Blue Lagoon. Enjoy a final night dinner with your group tonight. Day 9: Kokopo - Rabaul With no activities planned for today, you are free to depart at any time after breakfast. Please note that a transfer to Tokua (Rabaul) Airport is included today, so please ensure you inform us of your departure flight details.
