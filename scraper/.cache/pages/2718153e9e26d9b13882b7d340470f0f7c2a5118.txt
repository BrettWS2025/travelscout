Add a single supplement from $1495 Day 1: Arrival day Transport from airport to hotel. You will be met by Outdoor Samoa/Cycle Journeys staff to transfer you to your accommodation. Day 2: Introduction to your cycle trip Today is the start of your island cycle experience. Please be ready by 8:30am as we will collect you from your accommodation and transfer you to our depot. We will work through the bike fitting and provide a big picture overview of Samoa. Todays 8km cycle ride is an authentic experience led by our Samoan staff. They take you riding through their local village sharing their way of life with you. Breakfast is included. Day 3: Cycle to Matautu (26kms) Today starts with a 14 km gentle ride around the coast. At Falelatai, the road heads steeply uphill for 2 kms, climbing 200 metres. However, when you get to the top, the view over the lagoon is well worth it. Enjoy the picturesque downhill ride to Le Faga Bay in Savaia, home to the famous Giant Clams. These giant fluorescent molluscs are almost a metre long and located in a safe and sheltered lagoon. You will require your snorkelling gear on this day. Continue cycling a further 3.5km to your accommodation tonight. Breakfast is included. Day 4: Turtle Kayak Day Trip Today’s activity is going to be a highlight; The Turtle Kayak experience! Your support driver will collect you from your accommodation at 9:30am. A short 15km drive to Vai Villas, where you will then gently paddle through the mangroves and out into the lagoon. Large bales (groups) of turtles are usually seen. This lagoon is one of the few remaining with large sandy beaches suitable for nesting. The turtles are plentiful. Lunch will be provided at the completion of the Turtle Kayak at Vai Villas. Your support driver will then transport you back to your accommodation for an afternoon of relaxation. Today is going to be amazing! Lunch, and Breakfast are included. Day 5: Cycle from Matautu to Saletoga Beach (45km) Get on your bikes early, there is much to see and do. The ride includes 45km of rolling country side. The route follows the undulating sealed coast road, and while it’s easy to focus on just getting to the destination, there is a lot to do on the way. Potential stops include the Sinalei Resort for a nice lunch, and a walk to the Ma Tree, but our favourite is a long swim at Togitogiga Waterfalls. Your ride ends at Saletoga Beach. Breakfast is included. Day 6: Day of Relaxation Today is all about relaxation and wellbeing. Enjoy the resort. Book a massage. Go for a swim. Read a book. Have a few cocktails on the beach. After a big days ride yesterday, you deserve to treat yourself! Breakfast is included. Day 7: Cycle from Saletoga Beach to Saleapaga (15km) To Sua Trench is on the itinerary today. It will be your first stop, at 5km down the road. This collapsed lava tube is one of the picture postcard attractions of Samoa, with the steep ladder leading down into the sea water pools. The Trench and surrounds deserve a couple of hours at least. Take in the seascape, blowholes, beach and history along with a gentle swim in the pool. When you eventually make it out of the pool, ride the last 10km to your accommodation in Saleapaga. For those with energy and time to spare, there is an option to spend some time on Namua Island. It is a 4km cycle to Lalomanu and a further 4km to Muiatele, where the Namua Island Ferry departs. You will be able to leave your bikes (for a small fee) at the Namua Island Ferry owners house. Catch the ferry across to Namua Island, which takes around 10 minutes. Keep an eye out for turtles that are often seen in the lagoon. There are toilets available on the island. Take snacks and drinking water. Climb to the top of Namua Island to look for dolphins, whales, and gannets amongst other wildlife. Take the ferry ride back to Muiatele, and cycle the 8km back to your accommodation. Breakfast is included. Day 8: Cycle from Saleapaga to Apia (35km) The shorter and more interesting route is to continue around the coast and up Richardson Road. This includes a 400m climb, which provides views of the hydro storage lake, that connects via a tunnel to the powerhouse in Faga-Loa Bay. The alternative route is to cycle back towards Lotofaga Village and Sopoaga Waterfall. This is an easier ride, but slightly longer. Both routes meet together at La Mafa Pass Road and Richardson Road. The topography here is different from the rest of Samoa with near vertical green hillsides and the remains of several large mixed cattle and copra (dried sections of the meat of the coconut) estates. Stop and admire the view from Le Mafa pass (but be wary of crossing the fence into the bull paddock for a better picture). The ride down the hill can be exhilarating, but stop at the bottom to admire the Falefa Falls. From Falefa continue 2kms west on the main road to Le Uaina Resort. We suggest stopping here for a late lunch. Shuttle transfer into Apia. Accommodation is included. Breakfast is included. Day 9: Apia Enjoy the day at your leisure. Apia has a range of excellent restaurants and coffee shops. Robert Louis Stevenson’s home, Villa Vailima, has been turned into a fascinating museum and has an excellent guided tour. The Bahai’i Temple is a masterpiece of architecture with stunning views over the city. Don’t forget to also check out the ‘bus depot’, with a range of colourful buses. The fish, vege and dry goods (souvenir) markets are all well worth a look. Accommodation is included. Breakfast is included.
