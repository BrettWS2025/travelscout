Once home to the world's most powerful and civilized empires, Athens is now the world's foremost archaeological playground. The towering columns of the Parthenon still stand in homage to the virgin goddess Athena. The Parthenon sits atop the Athenian Acropolis and watches over the city where it can be seen from just about anywhere in Athens. Make it a point to visit the incredible Acropolis Museum on your cruise to Athens. The joint effort between two architects, one American and the other Greek, this outstanding building was completed and opened to the public in 2009. It focuses primarily on the Greek period dating to 5 B.C., considered to be the apex of art, culture, and philosophy in ancient Greece, but it also has artifacts from the Bronze, Roman, and Byzantine Ages. There’s even a Plexiglas walkway from which an excavated section of an old Athenian neighborhood can be viewed. In addition to an abundance of historical riches, modern Athens has plenty on offer—from scenic beaches to restaurants with superb Mediterranean cuisine and bustling central markets. Day 2: Kavala, Greece 11 Apr 26 Tendered: 9:00AM to 7:00PM Tucked into the northeastern coast of mainland Greece, just below the Bulgarian border, the hillside city of Kavala overlooks the Aegean Sea and is the main seaport of eastern Macedonia. Kavala will offer you a surprising mix of history, culture, and architecture—archeological sites, monuments, cobblestone streets, wooden balconies lined with flowers, colorful palaces, and hilltop fortresses—as well as diverse landscapes like lush wetlands, lagoons, inland lakes, beaches, and diverse flora and fauna. You will enjoy Kavala's welcoming climate, which stays warm and temperate throughout the year. And with a culinary scene that joins East and West, you will experience traditional and modern food with ingredients that small local producers source from the nearby mountains, sea, and wineries. With all that Kavala offers, you will see why people quickly fall in love with this seaside city. Day 3: Thessaloniki, Greece 12 Apr 26 Docked: 6:30AM to 8:00PM The second largest city in Greece, Thessaloniki has so much going for it—beauty, history, culture, and absolutely amazing views of the sea. One of its most famous sites is the iconic White Tower which dates from the 1500s and was built as part of the city’s fortification. Head to the top of it for sweeping views of the city, shimmering gulf, and surrounding hills. Practically an open-air museum of Byzantine art, Thessaloniki offers many opportunities to stroll among 5th century churches, archeological sites, a 13th century bathhouse, archaeological museums, and contemporary art museums. Day 4: At Sea - Cruising 13 Apr 26 While at sea, take the time to recharge before the next adventure. Lounge by the pool, be spoiled at the spa, taste the delicacies or explore the venues on-board, until we arrive at the next amazing destination. Day 5: Rhodes, Greece 14 Apr 26 Docked: 7:00AM to 4:00PM Rhodes, the friendliest city in the Mediterranean, is situated at the island’s northernmost point. This sunny retreat is also home to many historic sites, such as the ruins of the Temple of Venus and the medieval Street of Knights. Rhodes, pronounced ro-dos, is the largest of the Dodecanese Islands. The varied landscape with beaches, wooded areas, and ancient ruins also make this one of the most alluring of the Greek archipelago. A cruise to Rhodes wouldn’t be complete without exploring the picturesque Old Town with its winding streets and Byzantine legacy. Enter the gateways of Rhodes and step back to a time when the Knights of St. John of Jerusalem built a Christendom stronghold. Or, tour the restored Palace of the Grand Masters and the Hospital of the Knights. You can spend the day amid the chronicles of Greek history. Immerse yourself in the whitewashed romance of the archaeological site, Lindos and climb to the ruins of its ancient Acropolis for sweeping views of the village and the blue seas beyond. The island’s vibrant shops, great restaurants, and glittering clubs buzz with a happy, modern energy in contrast to the grace of its ancient history. Day 6: Limassol, Cyprus 15 Apr 26 Docked: 10:00AM to 7:00PM Limassol is the second-largest city in Cyprus, located on the island's southern coast. Stroll around Old City, an historic part of town with stylish cafés, restaurants, shops, bars, the Old Fishing Harbour and the former Turkish quarter. Visit the Medieval Castle & Museum, the scene of spectacular, shady gardens and a 12th-century wedding between Richard the Lionheart and Berengaria. Swim and picnic at Petra tou Romiou, the spot where the Greek goddess Aphrodite is said to have emerged from the sea. Day 7: At Sea - Cruising 16 Apr 26 While at sea, take the time to recharge before the next adventure. Lounge by the pool, be spoiled at the spa, taste the delicacies or explore the venues on-board, until we arrive at the next amazing destination. Day 8: Ephesus (Kusadasi), Turkey 17 Apr 26 Docked: 8:00AM to 7:00PM Once the capital of the Roman province of Asia Minor, this coastal town is now an archeologist’s dream. The UNESCO World Heritage ruins of Ephesus impress even those familiar with the world's other ancient cities. Though excavations have been underway for 150 years, only 20 percent of the city has been uncovered. This former Greek banking and trading center is rich with historic sites, including the Great Theater, the Temple of Hadrian, and the Temple of Artemis, one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. On your Europe cruise, check out the the Celsus Library — built in 117 A.D.— made up of towering columns highlighted by the statue of the goddess of wisdom. Day 9: Santorini, Greece 18 Apr 26 Tendered: 7:00AM to 10:00PM Here on the island of Santorini, you’ll find a classic Greek seascape—whitewashed houses accented by sea-blue roofs. This is a treasure trove for both professional and amateur archeology buffs, with sites that include tombs that date back to the 9th century and the sanctuary of Apollo. In many ways, Santorini could be considered an explosive place, being that its terraced collection of homes and windmills lie on a caldera-- a huge basin formed by an erupting volcano. The island’s volcanic past has also produced delicious grapes for excellent wines that are well worth investigating while on your Santorini cruise. Some of the best on the island can be found in Pyrgos, Megalochori, and Oia. Oia’s hilltop not only has the ancient, Minoan site of Akrotiri, but is quite possibly the best vantage point from which to witness the spectacular sunsets. And, if you have some time, take a short trip to the island of Nea Kameni for a dip in its famous hot springs. The warm dark waters are enriched with iron and manganese and considered therapeutic. Day 10: Mykonos, Greece 19 Apr 26 Tendered: 7:00AM to 6:00PM Mykonos is known for its whitewashed villages sprinkled with blue and jade green. It's also famous for its sophisticated nightlife. The most popular island in the Cyclades is bustling with activity, awash in beautiful alleyways, and home to alluring sandy beaches. Day 11: Athens (Piraeus), Greece 20 Apr 26 Arrival: 5:00AM Athens brought the world drama, history, poetry, and philosophy. Once home to the world's most powerful and civilized empires, Athens is now the world's foremost archaeological playground. The towering columns of the Parthenon still stand in homage to the virgin goddess Athena. The Parthenon sits atop the Athenian Acropolis and watches over the city where it can be seen from just about anywhere in Athens. Make it a point to visit the incredible Acropolis Museum on your cruise to Athens. The joint effort between two architects, one American and the other Greek, this outstanding building was completed and opened to the public in 2009.

Ocean cruising is an amazing holiday where everything you could possibly need is within easy reach. River Cruises A leisurely cruise along the world’s waterways is a relaxing, and luxurious, way to travel. Whether you’re navigating across Europe or cruising Southeast Asia’s Mekong River, each new day on a river cruise brings a new experience. Luxury Cruises Luxury beyond belief. Soak up Michelin-star fine dining restaurants, butler service, and luxurious suites. Luxury cruising appeals to those travellers demanding an unparalleled, all-inclusive travel experience away from the hustle and bustle of the large crowds What types of cruises are there? There are cruises tailored to every type of traveller ie; adults only, couples, families, retirees, singles, large groups etc. Depending on the cruise line will depend on the type of cruise available and what is best suited to the experience you want. Most offer a full range of activities and facilities to participate in as a family. Kids clubs are also offered in some ships and are focused on keeping children entertained. Be prepared, some are more “kid-friendly” than others -always check with your HOT travel consultant Many cruise lines have adults only areas, and some are even fully adults only cruise ships. The larger the ship, the more space you will have. If you are looking for something a little smaller and more intimate, your cruising specialist will help you find that. Can I go on a cruise if I’m travelling alone? Yes - taking a cruise is a great way to relax and see the world at your own pace. A cruise is a fun and safe environment to meet other people, or just soak up the experience solo. Ask your cruise consultant about what’s best for solo travel and find out about the special add on rates for single occupancy of double staterooms. Should I check in before I go YES - we highly recommend checking in online ahead of time. While the process differs between cruise lines, you will usually need to create an account and enter your personal and booking details. It’s a must to do this in advance as you will be provided with a lot of important information to ensure you are fully prepared. This takes the stress out of the boarding process. You may be offered a choice of a few different boarding times, although some cruise lines do pre-allocate this for you. Your check in process will also outline when your bags are likely to be available once you are on board. This is important as it may not be immediately so you might want to reconsider what you take as carry-on so you have some essentials on hand What happens when I embark Like all travel, ensure you arrive at your embarkation port on time (preferably a little earlier) for your allocated boarding time. Make sure you have your boarding passes printed, your luggage tags securely attached to your bags and your passport on hand ready to go. Look out for your designated terminal, drop off your bags, then make your way through the security process. This is very similar to an airport, with metal detectors and x-rays for smaller carry-on bags. Once through security, you will approach the check-in counter, where you will have your photo taken and receive your onboard card, which will serve as your cabin key, onboard payment method and onboard ID. Your luggage will be delivered to your cabin during embarkation. Is cruising expensive? Like all travel, the cost is dependent on a lot of factors – things like the length of cruise, destination(s), the type of cruise line or room type. But because there is so much variety, there will be a cruise to suit everyone's budget. It can work out to be great value for money compared to a regular fly/stay holiday. Will I get seasickness? Most modern cruise ships have stabilizers in place to ensure passenger comfort. Plus, cruise ships will alter their routes in advance to avoid any adverse weather patterns and storms etc. But if you are prone to motion sickness, you could find yourself getting seasick on your cruise holiday. You could try natural remedies or over-the-counter prescribed medicines to counter motion sickness. Do I need a passport or visa to cruise You will require a passport to cruise internationally. Some close to home domestic sailings will only require a valid driver’s license. It is always recommended to have a valid passport whilst cruising and is your responsibility to ensure you have the applicable photo identification. Some countries do require you to obtain a visa in advance if you wish to disembark the ship in port. You will need to check the visa requirements for the countries visited on your cruise itinerary. Countries such as China, Russia, India, Canada and the USA require all New Zealand passport holders to obtain a visa. Always check with your HOT travel consultant and they will direct you to the right information. Will I save money if I book at the last minute or early? We recommend that if you are looking for a great deal book your cruise early. Some cruise lines offer great incentives for the early booking travellers. Thery could be things like complimentary room category upgrades, bonuses and discounted prices. Some even do airline flight credits! But these deals are normally for a limited time and will not last. Join our HOT cruise newsletter / email database, and we will let you know when there are offers or special deals available. Cruise pricing, like most things, reflects supply and demand. The more demand there is for a particular cruise the higher the price will be. Demand could be determined by factors such as the destination, seasons & duration of the cruise holiday. Like anything, waiting till the last minute does involve risk. If you wait, your cruise may have sold out. Then there is also the possibility of getting the cruise but in a room category that you don’t want. Our expert advice is - book early! Onboard your cruise Is there a dress code on board It will depend on what cruise line you are sailing with. As a rule, casual dress is accepted during the day, with smart casual or formal attire being required at night. Most cruise lines do not accept caps, jandals, bare feet, swimwear or sleepwear in formal dining venues. Some cruise lines enforce a stricter dress code, with men required to wear jackets and women cocktail attire at dinner. If you do not comply with your cruise line’s dress code, you may be asked to leave a particular venue.

Some holidays include gratuities in the total price, whilst others might require you to pay once you are onboard. How much luggage can I bring on the cruise? Cruise lines are not generally concerned about how much luggage you bring onboard, so there are largely no luggage restrictions on cruise ships.

Don’t get caught out – make sure you check the details carefully and be aware of any restrictions. Airlines do charge for oversize or excess baggage. Be prepared, check the restrictions with your travel consultant or the airline carrier directly before you book your flights. Should I book shore excursions or do my own sightseeing? Talk to your HOT travel consultant, it depends on what you want to do. You have options – you can do the shore activities arranged directly by the ship, as the quality and service offered is guaranteed. A bonus, if the tour is delayed the ship will wait for you before it sets sail again. You can, however, book shore excursions, whilst on board, or in advance if you want a more structured adventure. Doing your own local sightseeing can be exciting, however you’ll have to pay close attention to time as the ship will not wait for you if you are running late. What currency is used onboard? This varies depending on cruise line and destination. You can almost guarantee that the currency on most cruise lines will not be in NZD. Ships based in Australia will usually have AUD onboard.

However, it is normally only a small difference per day to upgrade to an oceanview room (with a view). Or investigate an upgrade to a balcony/veranda room which offers floor to ceiling windows that open to allow the fresh ocean air in.
