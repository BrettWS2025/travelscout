Day to Day itinerary Day 1 - Glasgow, Scotland In the heart of the Clyde Valley, the bustling city of Glasgow contrasts starkly with the wild beauty of the surrounding countryside. Scotland's biggest city overflows with landmarks from its extensive artistic heritage and outstanding architectural tradition. The city's chequerboard layout makes walking through the major pedestrian thoroughfares easy: go with the flow and let the lively street atmosphere take you past the many Victorian monuments. Don't miss the collections on display in the numerous museums and art galleries. The Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum is an outstanding example. Day 2 - Fort William, Scotland A port town on the eastern shore of Loch Linnhe, Fort William is sometimes described as the "Outdoor Capital of the UK." Because it sits at the base of Ben Nevis, the highest peak in the British Isles, and is in close proximity to the dramatic landscape of Glencoe, it is a popular destination for hikers and rock climbers. For those looking for a less adventurous experience, the nearby Ben Nevis Distillery offers tours and tastings, and Old Fort and Old Inverlochy Castle are interesting historical sites. Day 3 - Portree, Isle of Skye Nestling in the crux of a gorgeous bay, Portree reflects the magnificence of the grandiose Isle of Skye as well as being its main town. Apart from the charm of its colourful houses, the town’s outstanding location on the banks of a loch makes it a very pleasant place to be. From its colourful harbour bustling with local craftsmen’s shops, you can take in a stunning view of the surrounding hills. Before trekking through the wilderness and drinking in the natural beauty of the Isle of Skye, check out some of the beautiful images in the Aros Centre. Day 4 - Kirkwall, Orkney Capital of the Orkney archipelago, Kirkwall, which means “church bay”, is an ideal stopover before continuing on to the Northern Isles. Sheltered in a wide bay, the lively town welcomes the visitor with its charming paved alleyways edged by old houses and craft shops. Tankerness House, the oldest homestead in the town, is a must-see landmark. But the true architectural treasure of the aptly named Kirkwall is none other than its remarkable red and gold stone cathedral. And because whisky is inseparable from Scotland’s identity, stop at the Highland Park Distillery for a highly instructive visit. Day 5 - Lerwick, Shetland Islands The small and charming capital of the Shetland Islands, with its sea front of old houses and narrow streets, offering travellers its old districts and a warm port atmosphere. Geopark Shetland, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is located to the north. Incredibly well-preserved archaeological sites and ruins prove that the islands’ occupation dates back to the first Neolithic colonies. The Shetland Museum and Archives recounts the Shetlands’ history of heritage and culture: Lerwick’s abundant waters were even fished by the Dutch in the past. Day 6 - Olden, Norway With its two wooden churches, one red and the other white, plus its breathtaking view of the mouth of the river Oldeelva, Olden looks just like a picture post card. Located a few kilometres from the Jostedalsbreen park, home to one of the last glacier polar icecaps, this little village is a definite must for exploring the blue languages of the Briksdal or Kjennalen glaciers. Make sure you find some time to visit the Norwegian Glacier Museum. Absolutely amazing. Another gem is lake Lovatn and its turquoise waters inviting you to quiet contemplation. Day 7 - Flam, Norway Nestled in the heart of the fjord country, less than 200 kilometres from Bergen, the picturesque village of Flåm – pronounced Flôm – offers you an experience of authentic Norway. You can mosey around the brightly coloured streets and admire the majestic contours of the surrounding mountains. The town is also the departure point for the mythical train route Flamsbana, 20 kilometres long, whose journey offers a superb view of the scenery, as sublime as it is pristine. This attraction makes Flåm one of the country’s main tourist destinations. Day 8 - Bergen ocated at the end of Byfjord, Bergen was the capital of Norway in the 12th and 13th Centuries and has preserved some very beautiful monuments from the time when it was home to royalty. Wandering through Bergen’s streets means going back in time, in search of the hidden treasures that have been listed as World Heritage Sites by UNESCO. A veritable openair museum, Bergen is home to a thriving artistic community of painters, potters, jewellers. The Bergen cable car offers you a splendid panorama over the port and the surrounding fjords. Do not miss the visit to the old quarter with its narrow streets, a testimony of the power of the hanseatic League that controlled trade in Northern Europe at the end of the Middle Ages.
