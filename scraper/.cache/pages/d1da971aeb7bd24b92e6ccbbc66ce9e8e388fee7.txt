While you won’t find any of these fearsome creatures roaming its streets today, you will be greeted with a glittering array of treasure-filled art galleries, elegant shopping arcades and grand royal palaces. Meet your small group of fellow explorers in the city’s vibrant heart where we'll settle down for our very first meal together. Local specialties you might spot on the menu? Crispy patatas bravas, simple but tasty tortilla and juicy campo real green olives tossed in fragrant herbs. Buen provecho! (D) Day 2: Toledo After a filling Spanish breakfast and a steaming mug of café con leche, we’ll swap the country’s current capital for its ancient one as we venture an hour south to Toledo. Perched above the serene Rio Tajo, it's often called the ‘city of three cultures’ – and we’ll discover why during a guided walking tour with our history-loving Tour Leader. Prepare to get lost in centuries of beguiling tales as we stroll beneath the horse-shoe arches of the Mosque of Cristo de Luz and gaze up at the gilded scallop detailing on the Synagogue of Santa María la Blanca’s vaulted ceiling. You’ll also have a chance to roam the storied galleries of the 15thcentury Monastery of San Juan de los Reyes, which was founded by Spain’s most iconic royal duo: King Ferdinand II of Aragon and Queen Isabella I of Castile. The afternoon is yours to delve even deeper into this diverse city. If you have a sweet tooth, don’t forget to seek out some intricately shaped marzipan. It's a Toledo speciality that’s been crafted by local artisans for centuries. And when you’re ready for dinner, ask your Tour Leader for the best places to try traditional Castilian delicacies like herby roasted partridge, crispy cuchifrito (deep fried pork) and paprika-spiced sopa de ajo (garlic soup). (B) Day 3: Córdoba We’ll be greeted by the waving arms of traditional windmills today as we weave our way through the golden-hued valleys of the lush La Mancha plateau. We’ll pause in the sleepy town of Puerto Lápice that’s best known as the setting of Miguel de Cervantes’ Don Quixote adventures. They’ll be time to uncover more about the suave fictional gentleman at the dedicated museum. Or you could seek out a local cafe to try a slice of tarta de flor: a moreish milk tart featuring layers of ruffled, flaky pastry. Then, it's onwards to Valdepeñas where we’ll savour the fruits of this fertile region at a local bodega. As well as sipping three sumptuous natural wines, we’ll tuck into a tasty homecooked lunch. You’ll also have a chance to purchase some wine in the bodega’s shop; the perfect souvenir to remind you of the day’s culinary adventures. Afterwards, our path will lead us to Córdoba: a city of jaw-dropping Moorish architecture, exhilarating equestrian events and fantastical fiestas. Spend the last few hours before dusk getting lost in its UNESCO World Heritage Old Town or enjoying a little downtime by the pool in your hotel’s sun-dappled courtyard. Eager to experience more of Córdoba’s local culture? Venture to the city’s 16th-century Royal Stables to watch its evening showcase that merges expert horsemanship with a touch of flamenco. ¡Olé! (B,L) Day 4 Prepare to step back in time to the days of Islamic Iberia during this morning’s locally guided tour around Córdoba Old Town. The highlight will be the spectacular UNESCO-protected Mezquita where we’ll marvel at the former mosque's mishmash of architectural styles – walking beneath orange and white striped Islamic arches and across glass floors which reveal the remains of ancient Roman mosaics. We’ll follow this up with a stroll around Córdoba’s Jewish Quarter. Wander past the bronze Maimónides Monument – dedicated to a famed medieval philosopher – and revel in the vibrant atmosphere of the artisan souk (known locally as El Zoco). Nestled in a small courtyard around the corner from the city’s 14th-century Synagogue, it’s the perfect spot to pick up local keepsakes like intricate silver filigree jewellery and hand-carved wooden puppets. Then, you’ll have another afternoon free to slow down and soak up Córdoba’s treasures. Tuck into some sugar-dusted churros at a cafe in Plaza del la Corredera: the site of the city’s bullring in the 16th century. Or settle down at a bodega to sip on a fifty-fifty – a heady local cocktail made with equal parts white wine and sweet sherry. Delicioso! (B) Day 5: Granada As we wave goodbye to Córdoba and dive deeper into the Andalusian countryside, you’ll notice one thing dotted across the landscapes: olive trees! We'll be sampling some authentic Spanish olive oil in Úbeda: a World Heritage-listed town bursting with elegant Renaissance palaces. Take a moment to admire the blue and white tiled tower of the Hospital de Santiago before we step inside the town’s Centro de Interpretación Olivar y Aceite. This museum is entirely dedicated to the cultivation of extra virgin olive oil. As well as enjoying a masterclass in olive harvesting with a local expert, we’ll savour the subtle differences between several oils during a tasting session. If that whets your appetite, they’ll be time to grab lunch before we continue our journey. Seek out ochíos con morcilla : a regional speciality featuring soft, paprika spiced bread rolls filled with savoury black pudding. Then, intriguing tales of revolution and the Reconquista await us in Granada – another of Spain’s UNESCO World Heritage treasures. Here, we’ll be snoozing like royalty in a former palace at its very heart. Dulces sueños ...(B) Day 6 Pomegranates are traditionally symbols of success and abundance – so it’s no surprise that Granada was named after this sweet, ruby-red fruit. The city has stood proudly at the foot of the soaring Sierra Nevada mountains for over 2,000 years, with its tapestry of incredible monuments a testament to its immense history. No visit would be complete without stepping foot in the ancient walled Alhambra fortress: one of the world’s best examples of Islamic architecture. The corridors of this intricately decorated complex whisper of enthralling stories – from the expulsion of the Moors in the late 15th-century to the bombardment of its towers by the French during the Napoleonic Wars. We’ll enjoy a guided tour around a few sections, remembering to pause and feast our eyes on the Alhambra's sweeping outlook across Granada’s Moorish old town. Then, you’ll have the rest of the day to weave your own path through Granada’s historical streets. Get lost in Albayzin's tangled web of lanes, admire the sunlight shining through the stained-glass windows of Granada Cathedral or clap your hands along to some flamenco at a cave bar in Sacromonte. There’s no better way to complete a day in Granada than settling down in a cosy local tapas bar. It’s still common for drinks to be served with complimentary tapas, too. A glass of full-bodied Tempranillo paired with fried anchovies or potatoes dipped in garlicky aioli? Yes, please! (B) Day 7: Ronda Ernest Hemingway once described Ronda as ‘a romantic set’ – and we’ll find out just why as we meander our way south to its dramatic location in the Sierra de las Nieves National Park. Your passionate Tour Leader will take you on an orientation through its cobbled streets and bodegalined squares, uncovering thrilling tales of bullfights and bandits as we go. Our stroll will end at Puente Nuevo: the largest of Ronda’s three bridges which hangs over the narrow, cragged chasm of the El Tajo Gorge. Then, the afternoon’s activities are up to you. Seek out Plaza Duquesa de Parcent in the heart of the Old Town and guess how many architectural styles have influenced the exquisite yet eclectic Iglesia de Santa María la Mayor. Or amble beneath the gently swaying trees of Alameda del Tajo park, pausing at its clifftop gazebo to soak up jaw-dropping vistas of the surrounding hills and vineyards. As golden hour approaches, why not regroup with your fellow travellers for a glass of delicious wine at the Hotel Catalonia’s rooftop bar? Clink your glasses as the sun sets over nearby Plaza de Toros de Ronda – casting fantastical shadows from the bullring’s arches and pillars. Then, it’ll be time for a delicious group dinner at a local restaurant. (B,D) Day 8: Seville A city known for fiery flamenco and juicy oranges is on our agenda today. But before we glide into stunning Seville, we’ll leisurely explore the scenic back roads of Andalusia – stopping off at several wonderful, white-washed towns in Cadiz province along the way. Grazalema is up first – and its lofty location among the limestone peaks of the Sierra del Endrinal is truly breathtaking. Spend an hour or so wandering the village’s cobbled streets that explode with colourful potted plants throughout the spring and summer. Next, we’ll feast our eyes on more hilltop vistas during a brief photo stop at the equally as enchanting Arcos de la Frontera. As lunchtime approaches, we’ll roll into Jerez – specifically the Bodegas Fernandez GAO where an indulgent sherry tasting and tapas feast awaits. Flutter your eyelids closed as you relish the aromatic notes of three sweet wines... If you’re feeling merry and content, why not settle down for a siesta in the minicoach? When you wake up, we’ll be in Seville where our evening plans include a traditional flamenco show at the prestigious Museo del Baile Flamenco. Hope you’ve practised your claps and heel taps! (B,L) Day 9 Two words to sum up Seville? Charismatic and colourful. This ancient city has stood proudly on the banks of the tumbling River Guadalquivir for over 2,000 years, and it shimmers with architectural gems. We’ll delve into one of its most famous – the UNESCO World Heritage Alcázar of Seville – on a locally-guided tour. Then, the rest of the day is free to get lost in local Sevillian life. Centuries of history make up the rich tapestry of this city and you could easily spend several hours roaming rugged Roman ruins, hunting down Moorish mosaics or ambling leisurely around the sweeping, classical-era Plaza de España. Alternatively, embrace the contemporary at the Setas de Sevilla: a series of space-age, mushroom-like structures housing the city’s archaeological museum and a sprawling marketplace. And, finally, don’t forget to end your explorations with a refreshing glass of quintessential orange wine at one of the abundant bars in the atmospheric Santa Cruz neighbourhood. (B) Day 10: Sierra De Aracena Today, we’ll swap the bustling streets of Seville for the tranquillity of the Sierra de Aracena – an unspoilt mountain range peppered with castles, quaint villages and sheep-filled pastures. It’s part of a vast national park crisscrossed with scenic, snaking roads which we’ll effortlessly traverse in our minicoach. As well as soaking up all the spectacular scenery out of your window, we’ll stop off at a local pig farm to indulge in an iconic Iberian treat: jamón ibérico . Watch the resident hogs’ curly tails twirl as they run around happily in the surrounding dehesa (pastures) before paying a visit to the farm’s cellars where the cured meat is dried. Then, it'll be time for the main event: a delectable tasting of several authentic jamón varieties paired with a duo of scrumptious local cheeses. With our camera rolls and bellies full, we’ll move onto our next hotel in the Sierra de Aracena countryside for an evening of leisure. (B) Day 11: Estremoz Ready to explore the Portuguese side of Iberia? After a lazy morning at our hotel, we’ll get comfy in our luxury minicoach and continue our journey west – pausing for a quick café con leche just before the border in Rosal de le Frontera. Then, say adiós ! to Spain as we enter Portugal’s Alentejo region – gaining an hour of time back in the process. That’s a whole extra hour to enjoy the delights of Monsaraz; an impeccably preserved medieval village. You’ll wander its winding streets during an orientation tour with your Tour Leader. Keep your eyes peeled for its four historic portas (gates) and feel the sun kiss your face as you gaze out over the Alqueva Dam that sprawls for miles across the wild countryside. After getting your first taste of Portuguese food for lunch (ask your Tour Leader for their favourite recommendations), we'll continue to Estremoz. Known as the ‘White City’ for its magnificent white marble architecture, you’ll have the remainder of the afternoon to explore its 13th-century Old Town before we reconvene for our farewell dinner. Tuck into some seasonal Alentejo delicacies and raise a toast to our Iberian adventure. Saúde! (B,D) Day 12: Lisbon After one last tasty breakfast together, we’ll venture further into the Alentejo region – stopping off in the elegant city of Évora. The Roman goddess of nature will be the star of our orientation walk as we amble past the town’s main attraction: the Templo de Diana. You’ll also have the chance to pick up a map of the area at the tourist information office; the perfect keepsake from our mini jaunt around Portugal! Then, tuck into a bowl of local sopas de pão – an aromatic soup topped with chunks of bread – before we hit the road for Lisbon. We’ll reach the undulating hills and tram-lined streets of the capital mid-afternoon and sadly say our goodbyes. But while the sun may have set on our Iberian journey – there’s plenty more adventures to be had in this captivating corner of Europe...
