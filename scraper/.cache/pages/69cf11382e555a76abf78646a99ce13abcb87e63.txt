Meet up with your brand new travel family and hit the road and head on a day trip to one of Australia's finest: the majestic Blue Mountains (which aren't actually blue, but are still beautiful all the same). Out here in the great Aussie Outdoors we'll be learning about the legends behind the famous Three Sisters rock formation as well as exploring the Jamison Ridge area. We'll head back to the city and the evening is yours to make the most of. Day 2 - Sydney This morning set out to explore this sun-drenched, cosmopolitan and eternally cool city. Your Trip Manager will give you the low down on all of the best bits as you get a tour of the highlights. Check out the Opera House, catch the ferry to Watsons Bay to experience the iconic skyline from a different perspective, then venture over to Bondi Beach where you can spend the afternoon lazing about in the sunshine. If you've got a head for heights, an optional Harbour Bridge climb is the best way to see that iconic harbour. Day 3 - Sydney A full free day to spend just how you like? Yep! Water lovers can opt for a jetboat across the Harbour. And sky lovers can opt for an epic skydiving experience. But if staying on land is your thing, Sydney's beautiful sights are equally as exciting. Day 4 - Sydney to Byron Bay With satisfaction levels at a high this morning we jump on a plane to Byron Bay where all your hippie dreams can come to life. Landing in Byron Bay (Cavvanbah), we'll drop off our bags at the accommodation and start as we mean to go on, heading straight to the beach. Here we'll unleash our secret talent for surfing with an included lesson. You'll be a pro in no time! Day 5 - Byron Bay We'll continue the surf vibes today with the option to kickstart our morning with sunrise at Australia's most easterly point. Then you have the rest of the day free to explore like a local. With the afternoon stretched out ahead of you, there's kayaking, relaxing on the beach and an evening bike tour to see glow worms in their natural habitat all on offer - your time here will be nothing short of magic. Day 6 - Byron Bay to Noosa Everglades It's time to wave goodbye to Byron Bay and head up the coast to Noosa Everglades. But first, why not opt for early morning yoga? Relaxed from our time at the beach, we'll head to our next destination, the Noosa Everglades. Here we'll unpack at our Special Stay Eco Lodge home for the next two nights and relax with a group dinner in the bistro &amp; bar area, surrounded by the chatter and rustling of local birds and kangaroos. Day 7 - Noosa Everglades (Including K'Gari) Wake up to the sound of birds chirping at our Eco Camp this morning (you might even spot a kangaroo) and grab a quick brekkie before heading out for a day on K'Gari. Your spirits will be at an all-time high after this day full of sand dunes, scenic lakes and dense rainforests. We'll cruise along the world's longest sand highway before you appease your hunger with a tasty lunch. It's back to the Eco Camp this evening for our final night here. You have free time to tuck into some food at the bistro, sample the offerings at the CootharaBAR boutique brewery, or just relax and enjoy the lush surroundings of this beautiful protected National Park. Day 8 - Noosa Everglades to Airlie Beach What better way to say goodbye to The Glades than with an optional Canoeing Excursion on one of only two Everglades in the world? Afterwards we're on our way to find coastal nirvana at the pristine beaches of the Whitsundays. We'll hop on a plane for a flight to Airlie Beach. Landing in Airlie Beach, you'll notice everything starting to look a bit more tropical. Hello Whitsundays! This afternoon is yours for the taking. Head out and enjoy the endless cafes, bars and ocean vistas this backpacker hub has to offer. Day 9 - Airlie Beach to The Whitsundays This morning we'll transfer to the marina and board a converted racing yacht - our home for the next 2 nights - ready to set sail over crystal clear waters. With 74 perfect islands at your fingertips, an open sea calling your name, today you'll get to explore one of the worlds most lusted-after holiday destinations with a day trip to the spotless Whitehaven Beach, including snorkelling. A freshly prepared lunch and dinner are waiting for you back on the yacht. This is as close to heaven as you can find on planet earth. Day 10 - The Whitsundays Is there anywhere in the world more beautiful than the Whitsundays? We think not. We'll have more wonders to enjoy today as we spend the day cruising through the islands, enjoying freshly prepared meals on board, with endless opportunities to snorkel, swim and soak up those rays. Day 11 - Whitsundays to Magnetic Island via Airlie Beach and Townsville Waking up on board the yacht this morning, we'll make our way to the shore. With our sights set on another beautiful island destination we'll board a coach, heading for Townsville. Here we'll board the ferry to our next destination. Magnetic Island (Yunbenun) is an apt name for this captivating isle, with its coastal walking trails and gum trees teeming with lazy koala bears. We'll have plenty of time to explore, try some water sports in the bright turquoise waters or meet some of the local marsupials. But first things first, we'll enjoy the sunset over the bay. Blissful or what? Day 12 - Magnetic Island We have a whole day on this paradise island - lucky us! Check out some of the walking trails - such as the Forts Walk which offers up stunning views of the Palm Island Group as well as WWII fortifications, and the chance to see koalas in the wild - or enjoy some free time at Horseshoe bay, taking a dip on the azure waters and relaxing on the beach. See Magnetic Island's resident Rock Wallabies at dusk before a free evening, where we can watch the sunset and check out some of the local bars. Day 13 - Magnetic Island to Cairns via Townsville This morning we'll say farewell to our koala friends and depart Magnetic Island on a ferry. But we'll never forget its singular beauty. Back in Townsville we won't hang around too long, as we're hopping on a train headed to Cairns, where we'll arrive late afternoon after a gloriously scenic journey along Australia's East Coast. Welcome to the city of Cairns (Gimuy), where rainforests meet reefs. We'll enjoy one of the most memorable meals you've ever experienced today with our interactive Bush Food MAKE TRAVEL MATTER® tutorial and dinner. An experienced chef will guide us through a history of Bush Food as you sample a variety of native spices and fruits, explaining their tastes, origins, and traditional uses before we enjoy our dinner, which features native game. It's an incredible cultural feast, and the perfect way to start our adventure in Cairns. Day 14 - Cairns Rise and shine, our entire day today is an unforgettable MAKE TRAVEL MATTER® experience, packed with history, heritage and natural beauty, as we enjoy a spectacular a day trip to the oldest tropical rainforest in the world: Daintree.With its ancient ferns and vibrant canopies, this place will take our breath away. There's a reason David Attenborough called it 'the most extraordinary place on earth.' As well as admiring the lush rainforest, we'll also meet the local Kuku Yalanji people and learn about their rich Aboriginal culture and history. We'll get the chance to view a smoking ceremony and take an art class with an Aboriginal artist. We'll also learn about ancient Dreamtime stories, local history and how these are shared through art. Then, we'll get to create our own unique souvenir to take home in the form of a canvas that tells our own stories.What a day; and our time in Cairns isn't over yet. Tonight, we’ll keep the magic going with the option of a sunset boat cruise. Day 15 - Cairns Today you'll have the option to board a catamaran out to the reef to snorkel or dive in the crystal waters and gaze at the colourful coral and even more vibrant marine life. Back on board, the expert marine crew will tell us all there is to know about this stunning, but vulnerable, natural miracle. Day 16 - Cairns Our adventure ends this afternoon, but not before we have a chance to escape our comfort zones and try some of the adventurous activities that Cairns is famous for - think bungy jumping, skydiving and whitewater rafting. Or, sign up for a day trip on the scenic cable car, Skyrail. Gain a unique perspective of Australia's World Heritage listed tropical rainforest, gliding above the canopy before descending to the forest floor to continue your guided journey in the tropical hippie paradise of Kuranda, a village known for its appreciation of sustainable living and alternate therapies. Take the famous Kuranda Railway back to Cairns for a relaxing end to the trip. More Deals Enquire *Terms and Conditions Offer subject to availability at time of booking.
