Take a closer look at the “Seven Sisters”, “Bridal Veil” and “Suitor” waterfalls, the majestic fjord cliffs and abandoned mountain farms. Perhaps you’ll be lucky enough to see porpoises playing in the fjord. Please note that the Geirangerfjord visit is subject to change due to weather and snow conditions. The mountain road from Lom to Geiranger normally opens from end of May. Alternatively, have a day to yourself in Lom. We suggest visiting Brimi Bue, a popular Lom hot-spot for fresh local produce and traditional Nordic flavours, owned by renowned chef Arne Brimi -the lunch time slot has good value options to try. Indulge yourselves in the historic atmosphere of Lom open-air museum and its houses dating from the early 1600s and experience the old farmer culture.
