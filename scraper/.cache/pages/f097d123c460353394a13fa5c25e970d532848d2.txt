Ocean cruising is an amazing holiday where everything you could possibly need is within easy reach. River Cruises A leisurely cruise along the world’s waterways is a relaxing, and luxurious, way to travel. Whether you’re navigating across Europe or cruising Southeast Asia’s Mekong River, each new day on a river cruise brings a new experience. Luxury Cruises Luxury beyond belief. Soak up Michelin-star fine dining restaurants, butler service, and luxurious suites. Luxury cruising appeals to those travellers demanding an unparalleled, all-inclusive travel experience away from the hustle and bustle of the large crowds What types of cruises are there? There are cruises tailored to every type of traveller ie; adults only, couples, families, retirees, singles, large groups etc. Depending on the cruise line will depend on the type of cruise available and what is best suited to the experience you want. Most offer a full range of activities and facilities to participate in as a family. Kids clubs are also offered in some ships and are focused on keeping children entertained. Be prepared, some are more “kid-friendly” than others -always check with your HOT travel consultant Many cruise lines have adults only areas, and some are even fully adults only cruise ships. The larger the ship, the more space you will have. If you are looking for something a little smaller and more intimate, your cruising specialist will help you find that. Can I go on a cruise if I’m travelling alone? Yes - taking a cruise is a great way to relax and see the world at your own pace. A cruise is a fun and safe environment to meet other people, or just soak up the experience solo. Ask your cruise consultant about what’s best for solo travel and find out about the special add on rates for single occupancy of double staterooms. Should I check in before I go YES - we highly recommend checking in online ahead of time. While the process differs between cruise lines, you will usually need to create an account and enter your personal and booking details. It’s a must to do this in advance as you will be provided with a lot of important information to ensure you are fully prepared. This takes the stress out of the boarding process. You may be offered a choice of a few different boarding times, although some cruise lines do pre-allocate this for you. Your check in process will also outline when your bags are likely to be available once you are on board. This is important as it may not be immediately so you might want to reconsider what you take as carry-on so you have some essentials on hand What happens when I embark Like all travel, ensure you arrive at your embarkation port on time (preferably a little earlier) for your allocated boarding time. Make sure you have your boarding passes printed, your luggage tags securely attached to your bags and your passport on hand ready to go. Look out for your designated terminal, drop off your bags, then make your way through the security process. This is very similar to an airport, with metal detectors and x-rays for smaller carry-on bags. Once through security, you will approach the check-in counter, where you will have your photo taken and receive your onboard card, which will serve as your cabin key, onboard payment method and onboard ID. Your luggage will be delivered to your cabin during embarkation. Is cruising expensive? Like all travel, the cost is dependent on a lot of factors – things like the length of cruise, destination(s), the type of cruise line or room type. But because there is so much variety, there will be a cruise to suit everyone's budget. It can work out to be great value for money compared to a regular fly/stay holiday. Will I get seasickness? Most modern cruise ships have stabilizers in place to ensure passenger comfort. Plus, cruise ships will alter their routes in advance to avoid any adverse weather patterns and storms etc. But if you are prone to motion sickness, you could find yourself getting seasick on your cruise holiday. You could try natural remedies or over-the-counter prescribed medicines to counter motion sickness. Do I need a passport or visa to cruise You will require a passport to cruise internationally. Some close to home domestic sailings will only require a valid driver’s license. It is always recommended to have a valid passport whilst cruising and is your responsibility to ensure you have the applicable photo identification. Some countries do require you to obtain a visa in advance if you wish to disembark the ship in port. You will need to check the visa requirements for the countries visited on your cruise itinerary. Countries such as China, Russia, India, Canada and the USA require all New Zealand passport holders to obtain a visa. Always check with your HOT travel consultant and they will direct you to the right information. Will I save money if I book at the last minute or early? We recommend that if you are looking for a great deal book your cruise early. Some cruise lines offer great incentives for the early booking travellers. Thery could be things like complimentary room category upgrades, bonuses and discounted prices. Some even do airline flight credits! But these deals are normally for a limited time and will not last. Join our HOT cruise newsletter / email database, and we will let you know when there are offers or special deals available. Cruise pricing, like most things, reflects supply and demand. The more demand there is for a particular cruise the higher the price will be. Demand could be determined by factors such as the destination, seasons & duration of the cruise holiday. Like anything, waiting till the last minute does involve risk. If you wait, your cruise may have sold out. Then there is also the possibility of getting the cruise but in a room category that you don’t want. Our expert advice is - book early! Onboard your cruise Is there a dress code on board It will depend on what cruise line you are sailing with. As a rule, casual dress is accepted during the day, with smart casual or formal attire being required at night. Most cruise lines do not accept caps, jandals, bare feet, swimwear or sleepwear in formal dining venues. Some cruise lines enforce a stricter dress code, with men required to wear jackets and women cocktail attire at dinner. If you do not comply with your cruise line’s dress code, you may be asked to leave a particular venue. Make sure you check with your HOT travel consultant - you don’t want to get caught out Do cruise ships cater for passengers with accessibility requirement? Yes, most cruise lines have accessibility assistance in place for passengers with disabilities. Cruise ships typically offer a range of wheelchair-accessible cabins, however, the number of these may be limited. You must advise at time of booking – make sure you speak to your HOT travel consultant and outline any requirements for you or your travelling companions Some ocean ships can be large, which at times can be difficult for passengers with mobility problems to navigate. To make things easier, on some cruise ships you can rent a scooter or wheelchair for the duration of your cruise. Always check in advance with your HOT travel consultant Can I smoke onboard a cruise ship? All cabins and public areas onboard cruise ships are strictly non-smoking / vaping. You can, smoke/ vape in the ship’s designated smoking zones only If in doubt, ask the staff onboard your ship. Are my valuables safe on board? If you bring valuables with you, they are best to be kept in your in-room safe. We also recommend you keep your passport, and any important documents locked in the your safe also. Are gratuities or tips included? This depends on the cruise. Your cruise consultant will outline this as part of the booking process. Some holidays include gratuities in the total price, whilst others might require you to pay once you are onboard. How much luggage can I bring on the cruise? Cruise lines are not generally concerned about how much luggage you bring onboard, so there are largely no luggage restrictions on cruise ships. But be aware, some staterooms have limited closet space! But remember, if you are travelling by air etc to your departure port, all airlines have weight and ‘number of bag’ restrictions. Don’t get caught out – make sure you check the details carefully and be aware of any restrictions. Airlines do charge for oversize or excess baggage. Be prepared, check the restrictions with your travel consultant or the airline carrier directly before you book your flights. Should I book shore excursions or do my own sightseeing? Talk to your HOT travel consultant, it depends on what you want to do. You have options – you can do the shore activities arranged directly by the ship, as the quality and service offered is guaranteed. A bonus, if the tour is delayed the ship will wait for you before it sets sail again. You can, however, book shore excursions, whilst on board, or in advance if you want a more structured adventure. Doing your own local sightseeing can be exciting, however you’ll have to pay close attention to time as the ship will not wait for you if you are running late. What currency is used onboard? This varies depending on cruise line and destination. You can almost guarantee that the currency on most cruise lines will not be in NZD. Ships based in Australia will usually have AUD onboard. Ships that cruise in a variety of destinations will have a currency to reflect their company's ownership, which could be currencies such as USD or Euro. Make sure you ask your HOT travel consultant in advance, so you are prepared. What if I require a special diet? If you have special dietary requirements, you should advise your HOT travel consultant at time of booking. If you do have special requirements, make sure you arrange your meals in advance. However, if you do forget, you can arrange it onboard. What room type should I book? A lot of first-time cruisers choose an inside room (internal without a window) mainly due to the cost. However, it is normally only a small difference per day to upgrade to an oceanview room (with a view). Or investigate an upgrade to a balcony/veranda room which offers floor to ceiling windows that open to allow the fresh ocean air in. Check with your HOT travel consultant Can I take visitors on board? Think of a cruise ship like an airplane. No you can’t. Due to immigration and security reasons only registered guests are permitted onboard at all times. Is there babysitting on board? Babysitting is available at extra cost on some ships. Many cruise lines will offer popular kids club facilities onboard, and some cater better than others. But if you are on a cruise that is targeted at families will be spoilt for choice for ways to entertain the whole family Is there WiFI and mobile reception? Yes you can. Most ships offer Wi-Fi throughout the ship, whilst some only offer in designated areas. Most cruise ships have internet cafes on board.
