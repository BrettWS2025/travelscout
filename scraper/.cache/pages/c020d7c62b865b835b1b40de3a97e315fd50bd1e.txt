Raro is just a 3-hour flight from Auckland – that means less time travelling and more time unwinding. Best time to go. May to October, is dry season and generally considered the best time to visit. However, even during the wet season (November to April), the rain showers are usually short-lived, and the islands remain lush and green. Time difference. Despite being a 3 hour flight away, New Zealand is 22 hours ahead of Raro (GMT -10). / Back Our favourite things to do in the Cook Islands An Island night to remember!
