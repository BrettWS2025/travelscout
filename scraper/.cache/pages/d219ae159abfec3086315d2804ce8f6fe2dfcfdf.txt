Embarkation begins at 1400HRS. Get settled in your cabin before going on a short orientation walk through this medieval town. Trogir is sometimes referred to as “miniature Venice” or a “mini Dubrovnik” because of its ancient walls, or a “floating museum town”, as it has a masterful architecture including some stunning Venetian palaces. After returning to the ship, enjoy a Welcome Reception followed by dinner this evening. (D) Day 2: Trogir - Split - Milna In the morning, we will head towards Split where you will join a guided tour of Split and visit the seafront promenade and Roman Emperor Diocletian’s Palace. The historical centre of the city is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. You will see the remnants of Split’s Roman heritage, its Renaissance and Gothic structures, Jupiter’s Temple, the Peristyle, and the Cathedral. After visiting Split, we head towards Milna on the Island of Brač with a swim stop, weather permitting, in one of pristine bays, time to relax and lunch on board. After lunch we arrive in Milna still known as the most beautiful and most protected harbour on Brač Island. Explore this Dalmatian town dominated by a Baroque church with a typical Dalmatian bell tower. The interior of the church is rich in valuable paintings by Venetian painters. Overnight in Milna or one of the alternative harbours on the Island of Brač. (B, L, T) Notes: Due to the limited capacity of the Split Port (reconstructions related) transfer by coach may be organised to and from Split for the sightseeing tour. Due to limited capacity of the Milna Harbour (during peak season), the port of call may be substituted with one of the nearby harbours. Day 3: Milna - Vis Leave Milna and Brač Island in the morning and cruise to Vis Island, once a strategic naval base and off limits to tourists. Due to this isolation, Vis has a special charm of the “Mediterranean as it once was” making it interesting to visit. Since the independence of Croatia, the island began opening slowly to the outside world. Some of Europe's largest and greatest naval battles had happened in the waters of Vis. Vis Island holds many historic secrets and we will explore Vis history by military Land Rover Defenders. Overnight in Vis or one of the alternative harbours on the island. (B, L) Note: Due to limited capacity of the Vis Harbour (during peak season), the port of call may be substituted with one of the nearby harbours. Day 4: Vis - Biševo - Hvar / Stari Grad Leave Vis in the morning and sail towards the Blue Cave, a magnificent natural phenomenon on the Islet of Biševo just in front of the town of Komiža. The possibility of our visit will depend on weather conditions, and you will be notified of this on board. Afterwards continue to the Island of Hvar, take a swim break and continue sailing through lunch. Upon arrival in the afternoon, disembark and join a guided walking tour of Hvar Town where you will see many historical sights of the town, such as St Stephen’s Square and Cathedral, the Arsenal with the theatre built on its first floor, and the first municipal theatre in Europe. Above Hvar Town is the impressive fortress Fortica offering magnificent views over the bay and Pakleni Islands. Overnight in Hvar Town or Stari Grad. (B, L) Day 5: Hvar / Stari Grad - Korčula Early in the morning we set sail for the Island of Korčula, with swimming stop, if weather permits, in one of pristine bays, time to relax and lunch on board. Continue towards Korčula, one of the most preserved medieval towns, thought to be the birthplace of the famous explorer Marco Polo. We will spend the night here. Take a walking tour of Korčula which takes you through its narrow, cobbled streets full of history. Evening is free to explore the town on your own. (B, L) Day 6: Korčula - Mljet NP - Slano - Ston - Slano In the morning head further south to the Island of Mljet. Join the Cruise Director for a stroll to the famous saltwater lakes in the Mljet National Park. Alternatively, you can rent bicycles, scooters, or kayaks to explore the National Park or the island on your own. Lunch on board and departure for a small village called Slano on the mainland. Slano is a peaceful fishing village, and the starting point to Ston, situated on Pelješac Peninsula, fortified small town famous for its oysters. Pelješac Peninsula is known as one of the best wine producing regions in Croatia. After exploring the town, we leave to a small nearby village to enjoy the authentic local oyster tasting. Tonight, enjoy Captain’s Dinner on board and overnight in Slano. (B, L, T, D) Day 7: Slano - Elaphiti Islands - Dubrovnik Early morning cruise to Elaphiti Islands with swim stop in one of the secluded bays. Continue sailing to Dubrovnik. Before we moor at the Gruž Port, we cruise alongside the old city walls. After docking, join a guided tour at the historical centre of Dubrovnik, walk through Stradun, both a street and a square, the most famous place inside the city walls, enlisted as UNESCO World Heritage Site. Your guide will show you the most interesting sights of the Old Town and you will visit the Franciscan Monastery with Europe's second oldest pharmacy. After city tour, you will have time at leisure to explore the Old Town, visit city walls, the Rector's Palace and the Cathedral, or take a boat ride to Lokrum Island or cable car to the top of the Mount Srđ. Overnight in Dubrovnik. (B, L) Day 8: Dubrovnik After breakfast it’s time to disembark by 0900HRS. You will be transferred to Dubrovnik Airport.
