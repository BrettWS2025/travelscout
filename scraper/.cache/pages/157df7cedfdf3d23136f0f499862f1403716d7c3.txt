Or Rubibi, in the language of the Yawuru people, who are the Traditional Owners of the land on which Broome is now located. Start your adventure straight away, setting off early this morning as you travel east to Fitzroy Crossing. When you arrive, join the Darlgunya Cultural Walk, where your local Indigenous guide will take you through the remnants of the old postal settlement and down to the Fitzroy Riverbanks. Learn about the wild Fitzroy River from your knowledgeable guide – its plants, wildlife and the significance to local culture. Tonight, settle into camp and watch the sunset and the stars as they come alive, away from the city lights. Day 2 China Wall to Purnululu National Park (Bungle Bungles) This morning, travel to Purnululu National Park (or better known as the Bungle Bungles). On the way, stop at the China Wall near Halls Creek – a natural white limestone wall which looks like a miniature Great Wall of China. Then, continue to Purnululu National Park. When you arrive, take some time to settle into your private permanent tented camp and take in the views of the Bungles Massif and the Kimberley night sky from your door. Day 3 Purnululu National Park (Bungle Bungles) Spend today exploring the highlights of Purnululu National Park. This UNESCO World Heritage Site is known for its landscape of unique orange and black striped ‘beehive’ geological formations, created by rivers over a period of 20 million years. To protect its unique landscape, the area was made a national park in 1987 and now boasts UNESCO World Heritage status. Visit the Echidna Chasm, known for its towering Livistonia Palm trees, then take a short walk into Cathedral Gorge, where towering rocks create a natural amphitheatre. Later today, maybe take an optional scenic helicopter flight for a bird’s eye view over the beehive domes. Day 4 Mimbi Caves to Fitzroy Crossing Say goodbye to Purnululu and travel to the ancient realm of Mimbi Caves – one of Western Australia's largest cave systems, on Gooniyandi Country. Spiritually significant, these limestone caves are one of the oldest identified sites of human occupation in Australia. Learn about Dreaming with a local Gooniyandi guide and hear the traditional stories and sacred meaning of this area. Then, explore the crystal-clear pools, fossils and ancient rock art before sitting down to some fresh damper and billy tea with the Gooniyandi Traditional Owners before you head back to Fitzroy Crossing. Day 5 Dimalurru (Tunnel Creek) to Windjana Gorge to Derby to Broome This morning, travel to Bunuba country – once a Devonian reef, this terrain is over 350 million years old and home to a diverse array of animals and plants. Along the way, stop at Tunnel Creek. Spend some time exploring the cave system here and learn about the legend of Jandamarra – an Aboriginal freedom fighter who used the tunnel as a hide-out in the late 1800s. Then, travel to Windjana Gorge where you’ll stop for a picnic lunch. As you walk through the outback oasis and beneath the gorge walls, look out for freshwater crocodiles, local birds and indigenous plants. Then, travel along the Gibb River Road from the Napier Ranges to Broome, passing the Derby ‘Boab Prison Tree’ along the way. Today is a bit of a long travel day, so maybe get stuck into your book or favourite podcast. When you arrive in Broome, your trip will come to an end.
