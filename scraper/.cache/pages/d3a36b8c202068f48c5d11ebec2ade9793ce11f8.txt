But it is Savusavu, one of the country's smaller islands in the north that offers perhaps one of the best – aka most authentic – experiences there is. The island is the archetype of paradise: turquoise seas and palm-fringed white beaches as far as the eye can see. Unsurprisingly many of the activities involve water: whether snorkeling and diving or exploring the inside of the island by kayak on the mangroved waterways of Sekawa River. As one of the lesser visited islands in Fiji, life and culture has remained very much as it always was in Savusavu; tourism is not rife and the island is buried deep in traditional ways. Expect warm communities eager to share their folklore and everyday lives, from local villages and birdwatching hikes to visits to black pearl farms and chocolate factories.
