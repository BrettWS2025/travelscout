Meet up with your Trip Manager this morning and your new Contiki Squad today as we say farewell to the home of Gaudi, sangria and year-round sunshine! You're not a real celebrity until you've frolicked on the French Riviera, and who are we to keep you off the A-List? Discover sapphire waters &amp; endless glamour as we roll along this glitzy coastline. We’ll kick back with an included dinner, then the night’s all yours to own. Day 2 - French Riviera Missing an opportunity to see this part of the world up close and personal would be criminal. An optional bike ride with the coastline as the backdrop is on the agenda this morning. Speaking of things you shouldn't miss, this region is famous for lavender honey, aioli &amp; rosé wine; all 3 in one meal should be your mission. Please tell us you didn't throw away all of your pennies on perfume today? Because you're going to want a few spare coins tonight so you can play fancy. We're visiting the Monte Carlo Casino &amp; the Royal Palace in Monaco. After a night on the blackjack table it's back to our cosy accommodation and to bed, the next part of the adventure starts tomorrow. Day 3 - French Riviera to Pisa via Cinque Terre Having exhausted all our hilarious Nice puns, we'll head south in search of the UNESCO World Heritage site of the Cinque Terre. Welcome to Cinque Terre, the sexiest collection of fishing villages on the planet. Armed with your rail pass, spend the day absorbing the dramatic beauty of this place, but we suggest you get out for a hike, a food crawl, some vino or all of the above. Then we'll head to our home for the night - Pisa.Oh, what a long but beautiful day it has been! We'll check into our hotel and get some well deserved rest. Day 4 - Pisa to Florence As if we were going to leave Pisa without a trip to the Leaning Tower. Depriving you of the chance to perfect the holding-up-the-tower shot would be down right criminal. Explore the city's markets complete with gelato in hand; marvel at artworks from the likes of legends like Michelangelo; and be impressed by the skilful art of leather at an included demonstration. These are the sorts of activities likely to fill your Florence agenda. Tonight you can choose to begin your Tuscan love affair at a Free Time Add-On dinner - think antipasti &amp; wine. Day 5 - Florence to Sorrento After farewell-ing Florence this morning we will journey along the boot of Italy until we reach the globally adored town of Sorrento for some blissed out coast hangs. "So so so so in love with Sorrento" are about the only words you'll muster up tonight as you sit seaside watching the sunset in this town of beauty. Here, you’ll have the chance to treat yourself with a visit to La Sorgente, a nearby locally-owned family mozzarella farm, for an authentic Italian meal complete with fresh homemade mozzarella, rich olive oil and sunshine-coloured limoncello. Day 6 - Sorrento It simply wouldn't be a trip to Sorrento without a side note to... We'll head over to the island of Capri for the day. With its gorgeous cragged coastline and opulent cafes, it's easy to see why this is such a playground for the rich and famous. If you'd like to spend some time on the water, opt for a cruise, with swim stops &amp; great views of the coastline. Back in Sorrento, we'll stroll along the plunging cliffs, explore the impossibly pretty historical centre and maybe even treat ourselves to some local gnocchi. Day 7 - Sorrento to Rome Another glorious Italian day awaits us. Iconic sites and ancient history will keep our jaws at floor level until our heads hit our pillows. After less than an hour gazing lovingly out of our windows at the Amalfi Coast, it will be time for a stop. Here in the ancient city of Pompeii you will have the chance to partake in a guided walking tour taking in Roman city remains. Today's roadtrip beauty is never-ending as we take in the volcanic beauty of Mt. Vesuvius en route to Rome. On arrival in the open time capsule that is Italy's capital, we'll hit the cobblestoned streets to check out some of the most famous sights this city has on offer. Day 8 - Rome Rome wasn't built in a day - so get up and get going early to make the most of this ancient city. Today will be a whirlwind of Roman architecture &amp; the chance to see the Colosseum up close. The afternoon’s free &amp; an optional pasta cooking class with dinner is on the agenda tonight. Oh, and treat yourself to some gelato, will ya? You’ve earned it. Day 9 - End Rome If anyone understands the pain of ended travels, it's us (and your new Contiki collective). Hug it out after breakfast &amp; make plans to reunite outside of Rome. More Deals Enquire *Terms and Conditions Offer subject to availability at time of booking.
