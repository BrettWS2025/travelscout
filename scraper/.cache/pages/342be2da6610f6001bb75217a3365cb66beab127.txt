Meet up with your new Contiki family in London town before hitting the road to Amsterdam. Shortly before we find our ferry for France, we'll be taking in the English coastline beauty of the White Cliffs of Dover. They owe their gorgeousness to their composition of chalk - you're learning and we haven't even left the UK! Off the ferry we arrive in the port town of Calais - French soil! We travel north via Belgium before reaching...Amsterdam! Tonight, the famed-for-fun Amsterdam is ours to explore. First fill up on your included group dinner, then you're free to explore or hit the local bars. And if you want a jaw-dropping view of the city from up above, might we interest you with an optional visit to the A'DAM tower? Day 2 Amsterdam Amsterdam is cute as a button & sure to win your heart with its canals, obscure museums & a café culture like no other. This afternoon use your time to get local, bar hop, museum crawl or even jump on a canal cruise. Hungry? How about an optional dinner at a local cheese-making barn? Day 3 Amsterdam to Berlin Out of Amsterdam, onto the autobahn and on the fast-track to uber-cool Berlin. That's on today's agenda.On the world map of cool party vibes, Berlin has a gold star. We've got two nights to explore every inch of this amazing city, and we'll kick it off with a bit of history into the city and its troubled and interesting past. Once we arrive your Trip Manager can point you in the right direction to go and see the sights. Day 4 Berlin Kick off the day exploring Berlin at your own pace. From the iconic Checkpoint Charlie to hidden side-street gems, the city is full of surprises. We've got two optional walking tours for you. Dive into the history of Third Reich sites or discover the vibrant culture of Kreuzberg. Either way, it’s a day packed with stories, sights, and a real taste of Berlin. Day 5 Berlin to Prague via Dresden "More city hangs" you'll all scream in unison as we motor out of Berlin, high on life & still wanting more. Since you asked so nicely, let us present you with Prague, the darling of Europe.A drive from Berlin to Prague would not be complete without stopping in Dresden. Destroyed by World War II, the rebuilt town is now a symbol of resilience, soaked in the re-birthed beauty of the Opera house, the domed Frauenkirche, & the Royal Residence. We've arrived in the compact & lovable city of Prague. You've got the evening to get a taste of the pints & palaces here. And then tomorrow, we'll check it all out. Day 6 Prague With a full day to loiter, expect an entire photo album of Gothic architecture, market antiques & you cheers-ing local beer; not to mention life! Tonight, we'll get out and go exploring, seeing castles and cathedrals and learning of Bohemian Kings and gothic history. Day 7 Prague to Munich We warned you about falling head over heels for Prague! Sorry team, you cannot live here forever. But there's no need to shed tears just yet, we're heading to somewhere even more exciting! It would seem we were born in need of some delightful Bavarian culture, we just didn't know it until now. Munich may be famed for its Oktoberfest festivities, but the spirit of things kicks on year round. A trip to a traditional beer hall will get you very well acquainted with things. Maybe right after you’ve toured the city on two wheels? Day 8 Munich to Austrian Tyrol via Dachau With no time to waste, we'll make our way to Austria this morning. We'll make a stop for a sobering visit to the Dachau concentration camp memorial. You'll be able to spend some time here to learn and reflect, before we head on. Ahhh, cool breeze on sun-kissed skin... we must be in the Austrian Tyrol. Before we reach our final stop for the evening, you'll have the chance to zip through the icy waters while white-water rafting. Afterwards, we'll continue on to Hopfgarten where a delicious welcome dinner awaits. Day 9 Austrian Tyrol A free day? In Austria? With epic Alpine views? It must be your lucky day…You have the chance to ride a bike through the valleys and enjoy a BBQ lunch. Or even better, paraglide over them. (Whee!) Day 10 Austrian Tyrol to Venice You'll think you've seen enough beauty for one day aer taking in the Central Austrian Alps & Brenner Pass en route to Italy.And then we'll arrive in Venice & your jaw will hit the floor over hidden lanes, story book bridges & a private canal boat ride. Day 11 Venice to Rome Farewell floating city, but Italy, we're not done with you yet, our next destination the Eternal City of Rome is just around the corner. The evening will really take it up to high key as we uncover Italian icons in the country's capital of Rome. With a city tour on arrival, we'll get a glimpse of Rome's glory by night, ready to be fully unveiled tomorrow. Gelato, pizza and ancient monuments, we're here for it all. Day 12 Rome This morning we're up and out early to make the most of our chance to explore this ancient city. You can opt to take a tour of the famous Colosseum and walk in the footsteps of Emperors and Gladiators in a guided tour, or snap epic selfies against a background of pink azaleas by the entrance. Visit the Trevi Fountain and throw coins to make a wish, sip espresso in a cobbled backstreet and soak up Italian life as it dances by. Or learn how to make pasta (and then gobble it all up too). When in Rome, right? Day 13 Rome to Florence With antipasto, good vino and golden countryside ahead, saying goodbye to Rome doesn't feel so bad. Cast your eyes over the city one last time this morning before we hit the road, bound for Tuscany. Florence, the capital of Tuscany, is more proof that Italy has so many great places packed into one small region. Here we'll get into the Tuscan vibes with a drop of Chianti wine, and take in the beauty of the city and its magnificent Duomo Cathedral. Tonight you can choose to begin your Tuscan love affair at an optional dinner - think olives, cured meats, crostini & wine. Day 14 Florence Ready for a full day of all things Florence? Take a moment to take in the unique beauty of this beautiful city where culture and la dolce vita is evident in every direction you look at. We'll learn the art of Florentine leather before venturing off to see what this "city of dreams" has in store for the afternoon.
