On arrival in Delhi, you'll be transferred to your hotel where you'll meet your Travel Director and fellow travellers for a dinner this evening. Day 2 - Discover the Delights of Old Delhi Dive Into Culture Savour the scents of spice as you embark on an exhilarating rickshaw ride, navigating the busy streets of Old Delhi. See the Red Fort, a sandstone fortress which once housed the emperors of the Mughal dynasty for centuries. Next, Dive Into Culture as you ride through the colourful Chandni Chowk market and watch it come to life as the day's trading begins amidst the sounds of enthusiastic salesmen and endless traffic. Visit Jama Masjid, one of the largest mosques in India. Admire its ornate façades before boarding a waiting vehicle to drive to Raj Ghat, a memorial dedicated to Mahatma Gandhi. Pay tribute to this beloved figurehead, who led the campaign for India’s independence from Britain. You’ll come face-to-face with the site where he was cremated following his assassination in 1948. Today the simple square platform of black marble is surrounded by a tranquil park, befitting of its status as a place of contemplation. Your next stop is Agrasen Ki Baoli, one of the most noteworthy stepwells in Delhi. Hidden amidst the cacophony of Delhi’s streets and business towers, this ancient water reservoir rises from the depths of the earth to stand atop 103 stone steps. Spend a few moments of serenity amidst its centuries-old ornate arches before returning to your hotel for an afternoon of leisure or consider one of our Optional Experiences. Day 3 - See the Sights of Delhi Make Travel Matter This morning, embark on a guided walking tour to discover the work done by the Salaam Baalak Trust, a MAKE TRAVEL MATTER® Experience. This non-profit organisation that aims to provide a caring environment for street children. Later, we'll walk through the bazaar of Paharganj, rubbing shoulders with the locals who flock to the market to shop everyday. Escape the noise and head to New Delhi, designed and built by the British in the 1920s. Your first stop here is a visit to the UNESCO-listed Humayun's Tomb, the earliest example of Mughal architecture in India. Recently renovated with the gardens restored to their former glory, you’ll see first-hand why it served as the inspiration for the design of the famous Taj Mahal. Enjoy local flavours for lunch at a restaurant near India Gate, then head to the Qutub Minar complex, also a UNESCO listed site. This fluted ‘Victory Tower’ is decorated with elaborate inscriptions, geometric carvings and elegant balconies. Returning to your hotel later, drive past Lutyens' Delhi to view the elegant colonial façades leading British architect Edwin Lutyens left behind on the cityscape. You'll have the rest of the afternoon at leisure, or perhaps join one of our Optional Experiences. Day 4 - Sunset at the Taj Mahal It’s time to leave Delhi behind, bound for the Uttar Pradesh city of Agra. There are many reasons to love Agra and its own ‘monument to love’, the Taj Mahal, is perhaps the most captivating of all. Marvel at its elegant marble façades awash with the sunset's rose and golden hues. Admire this well-preserved landmark from all sides and take time to contemplate the magnificence of this man-made wonder before re-joining your fellow travellers. This evening, you could choose to end a memorable day at an optional sound and light show prior to dinner. Day 5 - From the Taj to the Tigers Stays With Stories There’s more to Agra than the Taj Mahal, as you’ll discover during your visit to the UNESCO-listed Agra Fort. Walk through the chambers of this 17th-century residence, once home to Mughal emperors before the capital moved to Delhi. You’ll then explore Fatehpur Sikri, the once-grand 'Ghost Town' built by Emperor Akbar and abandoned soon after. Its red sandstone buildings remain hauntingly intact. After visiting Bharatpur, board a train to Ranthambore: where you’ll stay at The Shergarh Resort, one of our Stays with Stories. This simple, family-run hotel was founded by a local who grew up near the park and now supports his village through tourism. Day 6 - Roam Ranthambore in Search of Tigers Head out on an early morning game drive, one of the best times to spot the elusive Bengal tiger. Animals spotted and breakfast eaten, visit Dhonk Textile Studio, a MAKE TRAVEL MATTER® Experience, where local women create handcrafted textiles as part of a conservation initiative that supports ethical livelihoods and protects wildlife. Enjoy some time to unwind before heading back into the park for your second game drive, making the most of your last chance to spot Ranthambore’s incredible wildlife. Day 7 - Onwards to Jaipur Dive Into Culture Continue your journey to Jaipur, the Pink City. After some free time for lunch, join a workshop on hand-block printing, one of the most famous traditional art forms of Rajasthan. A Local Specialist will show you the tricks of the trade as you observe how the prints are handmade using small wooden blocks and hone your own block-printing skills.Later, Dive Into Culture and see the talents of local craftspeople on display during a visit to a local market. Admire the colourful textiles and perhaps buy a memento or two to take home. Jaipur is particularly renowned for its embroidery and blue pottery.This evening, join a local family for an exclusive Be My Guest experience with dinner in their home and savour some of the regional delicacies. Day 8 - Explore Colourful Jaipur One of today's highlights is a visit to the UNESCO-listed Amber Fort. But first, stop to admire the red and pink façades of the Palace of Winds, whose latticed windows once revealed the outside world to the sheltered ladies of the royal household. Continue with a visit to the ornate City Palace, an impressive complex of buildings from different eras and gardens in the heart of the Old City. Enjoy some time for lunch before visiting the UNESCO-listed Jantar Mantar Observatory, featuring the world's largest sundial. Later, perhaps join our optional Aarti ceremony, offering a blessing to one of the Hindu deities and hopefully receiving one in return. This evening, we'll toast to shared memories over a delicious local Farewell Dinner with those guests ending their journey in Jaipur. Day 9 - Venutre to Varanasi Dive Into Culture Make Travel Matter Depart Jaipur this morning and board your included flight to embark on a pilgrimage to the sacred city of Varanasi to explore the city's role as the centre of Hindu religion. There’s a palpable sense that life begins and ends on the shores of Ganga Mata (Mother Ganges), but local spirituality extends beyond the sacred waters of the river. The city is also renowned for its ancient temples and old ghats that lead down to the river. You’ll see all this and more, but first there’s free time for lunch before the sightseeing. Next experience a rural way of life while visiting weavers in Varanasi, where a Local Specialist reveals the centuries-old silk weaving tradition. Your visit during this MAKE TRAVEL MATTER® Experience will help the community’s efforts to keep this extraordinary tradition alive. You'll see first-hand how the talented weavers create beautiful silk fabrics. These are used to make the famous Banarasi silk saris, highly sought after for weddings and other special occasions. Later this evening, feed your soul as you cruise down the River Ganges to witness the ritual of Aarti. Watch as the delicate diya, laden with candles and tiny flowers, float down the river. After this poignant ritual, return to the hotel for dinner. Day 10 - Witness Local Life Along the Ganges Admire the changing light as the sun rises over the Ganges, and the sights and sounds of Varanasi come to life along the banks of the river. Observe locals taking their morning bath in the holy water and worshipping the rising sun. Afterwards explore the city on foot, the best way to immerse yourself in the day-to-day of the oldest living city of the world. You’ll have an opportunity to visit Kashi Vishwanath Temple, Varanasi's main temple. Demolished and rebuilt many times over its history, the temple is a sight to behold with its towering spire and domes made of pure gold. Return to your hotel for breakfast and some free time. Perhaps choose to join our Optional Experience to watch a live performance of Indian classical dances known as Kathak. This afternoon, visit Sarnath, one of the four holy Buddhist sites sanctioned by the Buddha himself for pilgrimage. Explore the spectacular collection of Buddhist artefacts dating back to the 3rd century BC and see the Lion Capital of Ashoka with its inverted lotus carving, adopted as the national emblem of India. Continue to your hotel for an evening at leisure. Day 11 - Farewell Varanasi Your spiritual and cultural encounter with India at its end, it's time to bid farewell to Varanasi.
