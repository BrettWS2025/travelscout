Welcome to Turkey and the start of your holiday. There's an included arrival transfer to our hotel. After check in, relax in the hotel or head out and explore the city. At 8 pm, we'll gather in the hotel to meet our fellow travellers and the guide before our adventure begins. Day 2 The Old City This morning we'll embark on a fascinating tour through the Old City of Istanbul, we'll visit stunning examples of architecture that hail from the Byzantine and Ottoman Empires eras. We'll visit the stunning Blue Mosque, both inside and out. See the six exterior minarets and the famed blue Iznik tiles. Discover the Hippodrome and view the exterior of Hagia Sophia, which was constructed as a Basilica in the 6th century by Emperor Justinian. Finally, we explore the impressive interior of Topkapi Palace, which was the main residence of the Ottoman sultans in the 15th century. Day 3 Gallipoli - WW1 Battlefields Istanbul - Gallipoli. Today we explore ANZAC Cove and the many memorials dotted across the WW1 battlefields. Our guided tour takes in sights including ANZAC Cove, Lone Pine Memorial and cemetery, Chunuk Bair Memorial and cemetery, the Nek, Johnston's Jolly and the many fortified trenches still clearly visible amongst the scrub after all these years. Day 4 Troy & Kusadasi Gallipoli - Kusadasi. This morning we enjoy a short guided tour of Troy. The legend of the lost city of Troy and Homer's poetry was brought to life by it's rediscovery in 1863. Subsequent excavations revealed nine ancient cities, one on top of the other, dating back to 3000 BC. We enjoy a tour of the ruins and admire a replica of the Trojan wooden horse that, as legend goes, was filled with Aechaean soldiers who helped to sack Troy. Driving further south we reach the ancient ruins of Pergamum, home to one of the steepest amphitheatres in the classical world. Pergamum was also famous for its Asclepion (medical centre). We continue to Kusadasi on the Aegean Coast via a leather manufacturing house. Day 5 Ancient Ephesus Today, we explore legendary Ephesus - perhaps the best-preserved classical city in the eastern Mediterranean. Under Roman rule, Ephesus was a vast and prosperous city with a population nearing 250,000. It was an important centre of commerce and a popular destination for pilgrims who came to see the great Temple of Artemis - one of the Seven Ancient Wonders. We have plenty of time to tour the marble ruins of Ephesus. Discover the famous Library of Celsus, the Stadium, the gymnasium of Vedius and the Great Theatre. We'll see ancient public toilets, a brothel, fountains and various temples. There's also a visit to a carpet manufacturing house. Day 6 Pamukkale Thermal Pools Kusadasi - Pamukkale. Driving east, we arrive at Pamukkale - home of the famous gleaming white calcium terraced pools. Known locally as the Cotton Castles, they're a natural phenomena and gift from Mother Nature. Pamukkale was formed when warm, calcium rich mineral water cascaded over the cliff edge, cooling and depositing in the process. The calcium built natural shelves and pools on the cliffs are known as travertines. Take a barefoot walk along the travertines or opt for a dip in the warm waters of the thermal pool, with its submerged fragments of fluted marble columns. Our last stop of the day is the ruined spa town of Hierapolis, famed for the curative powers of its mineral springs. These were dammed to create communal baths. Day 9 Back to Istanbul Cappadocia - Istanbul. Today we head back to Istanbul, stopping en route for lunch (payable locally). We arrive into Istanbul in the evening. If you'd prefer to avoid the long journey over land today, we also offer the opportunity to fly from Cappadocia to Istanbul. Day 10 Istanbul Monday. After breakfast our tour draws to a close. An onward departure transfer is included to Istanbul International Airport and is offered at 9am and 1pm today.
