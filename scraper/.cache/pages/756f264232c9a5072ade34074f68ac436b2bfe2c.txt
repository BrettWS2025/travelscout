You’ll find a relaxed atmosphere here,where urban buzz combines with the legendary laid-back Polynesian lifestyle. Culture is not lacking. You can enjoy sites narrating the history of the archipelago, including the colonial cathedral and the Maison de la reine Marau. The Vaipahi public gardens will win you over by their abundant plant-life. The large municipal market offers local specialities: fresh fruit, spices and all kinds of fish abound on their stalls. Day 2: Huahine, Society Islands Located less than 200 kilometres north-west of Tahiti, Huahine Island is a secret gem in French Polynesia. You’ll love the mysterious atmosphere emanating from its voluptuous contours, its wild vegetation and stunning remote creeks. If you explore both parts of the island, la Grande Huahine to the north, and la Petite Huahine to the south, will reveal some of its hidden treasures, as well as some archaeological remains from the Polynesian past. You can meet the local population in the main town of Fare, or in the string of villages along the coast. Day 3: At Sea During your journey at sea, make the most of the many services and activities on board. Treat yourself to a moment of relaxation in the spa or stay in shape in the fitness centre. Depending on the season, let yourself be tempted by the swimming pool or a spot of sunbathing. This journey without a port of call will also be an opportunity to enjoy the conferences or shows proposed on board, depending on the activities offered, or to do some shopping in the boutique or to meet the PONANT photographers in their dedicated space. As for lovers of the open sea, they will be able to visit the ship’s upper deck to admire the spectacle of the waves and perhaps be lucky enough to observe marine species. A truly enchanted interlude, combining comfort, rest and entertainment. Day 4: Aitutaki Aitutaki is a little island of 16 km², with a small fishing port with few motor boats, where a simple and peaceful life endures. During your visit, don’t miss the opportunity to walk along this magnificent lagoon, reputed as one of the most beautiful and spectacular in the world. Snorkelling fans will discover the treasures of underwater life here. The island is specialised in the sale of black pearls and the production of coloured sarongs, as well as “tivaevae” — patchwork quilting and handiworks. This local manufacture has great value because of its careful artisanal fabrication, and the pieces made are generally offered at important occasions. Day 5: Rarotonga You will be dazzled by the magnificent volcanic silhouette of Rarotonga, the largest of the Cook Islands. Perfectly circular, Rarotonga is closely surrounded by a coral reef over which break the endless waves of the south Pacific Ocean. The undulating profile of its sheer mountains standing out against the deep blue of the sky gives a glimpse of its summits at more than 600 metres altitude, such as Te Manga peak. The abrupt and vertiginous slopes are covered with luxuriant vegetation, a precious natural resource for the inhabitants of the island who have learnt to take advantage of this abundant nature and have developed a thriving agricultural sector. Day 6: At Sea At Sea Day 7-8: Bora Bora, Society Islands Paradisiacal atoll of the archipelago of the Leeward Islands, west of French Polynesia, mythical Bora Bora offers a natural spectacle of captivating beauty. You’ll be won over as much by the white sandy beaches as by its famous lagoon, one of the most beautiful in the world, where colourful fish frolic in waters of incomparable turquoise. The island is covered with tropical vegetation, and dominated by the majestic outline of Mount Otemanu. A promenade through this volcanic landscape will enable you to discover a number of villages and meet local communities. Day 9: Motu Mahana, Taha'a Island, Society Islands Feet in the sand, on the islet of Motu Mahana, our sumptuous little private paradise, you will share a very special experience around an authentic traditional Polynesian barbecue. A veritable jewel in the Taha’a lagoon, pristine atoll of the Society Islands, Motu Mahana offers an infinite palette of shades of turquoise, an idyllic backdrop for observing the majestic ballet of the tropical fish. The volcanic island of Taha’a, dominated by Mount Ohiri and Mount Puurauti, will reveal its fertile and luxuriant nature, ideal for cultivating the magnificent black pearls of French Polynesia, as well as vanilla. This rare spice, greatly in demand by gourmets, is the main economic resource of what is also known as Vanilla Island . Day 10-11: Moorea Island, Tahiti A part of the Windward Island archipelago just to the west of Tahiti, famous Mo'orea will leave you with a series of unforgettable images and memories. Bask on its heavenly beaches, enjoy a dip in the turquoise waters of its lagoon, and soak up its luscious vegetation and the heady flowers that carpet the inland areas. Get the most out of this natural gem with a trip to the Mo'orea Belvedere. Exceptional views of Mount Rotui unfurl before your eyes, with the Opunohu Bay and its valley to the left, and the famous Cook's Bay, surrounded by notched, cathedral-style peaks, to the right.

Frequently Asked Questions Planning your cruise How do I choose which type of cruise is right for me There are three main types of cruising Ocean Cruises There is a wide range of itineraries, cruise lines and cruise ships to choose from for those seeking an ocean experience, or an exciting adventure across many countries. Ocean cruising is an amazing holiday where everything you could possibly need is within easy reach. River Cruises A leisurely cruise along the world’s waterways is a relaxing, and luxurious, way to travel. Whether you’re navigating across Europe or cruising Southeast Asia’s Mekong River, each new day on a river cruise brings a new experience. Luxury Cruises Luxury beyond belief. Soak up Michelin-star fine dining restaurants, butler service, and luxurious suites. Luxury cruising appeals to those travellers demanding an unparalleled, all-inclusive travel experience away from the hustle and bustle of the large crowds What types of cruises are there? There are cruises tailored to every type of traveller ie; adults only, couples, families, retirees, singles, large groups etc. Depending on the cruise line will depend on the type of cruise available and what is best suited to the experience you want. Most offer a full range of activities and facilities to participate in as a family. Kids clubs are also offered in some ships and are focused on keeping children entertained. Be prepared, some are more “kid-friendly” than others -always check with your HOT travel consultant Many cruise lines have adults only areas, and some are even fully adults only cruise ships. The larger the ship, the more space you will have. If you are looking for something a little smaller and more intimate, your cruising specialist will help you find that. Can I go on a cruise if I’m travelling alone? Yes - taking a cruise is a great way to relax and see the world at your own pace. A cruise is a fun and safe environment to meet other people, or just soak up the experience solo. Ask your cruise consultant about what’s best for solo travel and find out about the special add on rates for single occupancy of double staterooms. Should I check in before I go YES - we highly recommend checking in online ahead of time. While the process differs between cruise lines, you will usually need to create an account and enter your personal and booking details. It’s a must to do this in advance as you will be provided with a lot of important information to ensure you are fully prepared. This takes the stress out of the boarding process. You may be offered a choice of a few different boarding times, although some cruise lines do pre-allocate this for you. Your check in process will also outline when your bags are likely to be available once you are on board. This is important as it may not be immediately so you might want to reconsider what you take as carry-on so you have some essentials on hand What happens when I embark Like all travel, ensure you arrive at your embarkation port on time (preferably a little earlier) for your allocated boarding time. Make sure you have your boarding passes printed, your luggage tags securely attached to your bags and your passport on hand ready to go. Look out for your designated terminal, drop off your bags, then make your way through the security process. This is very similar to an airport, with metal detectors and x-rays for smaller carry-on bags. Once through security, you will approach the check-in counter, where you will have your photo taken and receive your onboard card, which will serve as your cabin key, onboard payment method and onboard ID. Your luggage will be delivered to your cabin during embarkation. Is cruising expensive? Like all travel, the cost is dependent on a lot of factors – things like the length of cruise, destination(s), the type of cruise line or room type. But because there is so much variety, there will be a cruise to suit everyone's budget. It can work out to be great value for money compared to a regular fly/stay holiday. Will I get seasickness? Most modern cruise ships have stabilizers in place to ensure passenger comfort. Plus, cruise ships will alter their routes in advance to avoid any adverse weather patterns and storms etc. But if you are prone to motion sickness, you could find yourself getting seasick on your cruise holiday. You could try natural remedies or over-the-counter prescribed medicines to counter motion sickness. Do I need a passport or visa to cruise You will require a passport to cruise internationally. Some close to home domestic sailings will only require a valid driver’s license. It is always recommended to have a valid passport whilst cruising and is your responsibility to ensure you have the applicable photo identification. Some countries do require you to obtain a visa in advance if you wish to disembark the ship in port. You will need to check the visa requirements for the countries visited on your cruise itinerary. Countries such as China, Russia, India, Canada and the USA require all New Zealand passport holders to obtain a visa. Always check with your HOT travel consultant and they will direct you to the right information. Will I save money if I book at the last minute or early? We recommend that if you are looking for a great deal book your cruise early. Some cruise lines offer great incentives for the early booking travellers. Thery could be things like complimentary room category upgrades, bonuses and discounted prices. Some even do airline flight credits! But these deals are normally for a limited time and will not last. Join our HOT cruise newsletter / email database, and we will let you know when there are offers or special deals available. Cruise pricing, like most things, reflects supply and demand. The more demand there is for a particular cruise the higher the price will be. Demand could be determined by factors such as the destination, seasons & duration of the cruise holiday. Like anything, waiting till the last minute does involve risk. If you wait, your cruise may have sold out. Then there is also the possibility of getting the cruise but in a room category that you don’t want. Our expert advice is - book early! Onboard your cruise Is there a dress code on board It will depend on what cruise line you are sailing with. As a rule, casual dress is accepted during the day, with smart casual or formal attire being required at night. Most cruise lines do not accept caps, jandals, bare feet, swimwear or sleepwear in formal dining venues. Some cruise lines enforce a stricter dress code, with men required to wear jackets and women cocktail attire at dinner. If you do not comply with your cruise line’s dress code, you may be asked to leave a particular venue. Make sure you check with your HOT travel consultant - you don’t want to get caught out Do cruise ships cater for passengers with accessibility requirement? Yes, most cruise lines have accessibility assistance in place for passengers with disabilities. Cruise ships typically offer a range of wheelchair-accessible cabins, however, the number of these may be limited. You must advise at time of booking – make sure you speak to your HOT travel consultant and outline any requirements for you or your travelling companions Some ocean ships can be large, which at times can be difficult for passengers with mobility problems to navigate. To make things easier, on some cruise ships you can rent a scooter or wheelchair for the duration of your cruise. Always check in advance with your HOT travel consultant Can I smoke onboard a cruise ship? All cabins and public areas onboard cruise ships are strictly non-smoking / vaping. You can, smoke/ vape in the ship’s designated smoking zones only If in doubt, ask the staff onboard your ship. Are my valuables safe on board? If you bring valuables with you, they are best to be kept in your in-room safe. We also recommend you keep your passport, and any important documents locked in the your safe also. Are gratuities or tips included? This depends on the cruise. Your cruise consultant will outline this as part of the booking process. Some holidays include gratuities in the total price, whilst others might require you to pay once you are onboard. How much luggage can I bring on the cruise? Cruise lines are not generally concerned about how much luggage you bring onboard, so there are largely no luggage restrictions on cruise ships. But be aware, some staterooms have limited closet space! But remember, if you are travelling by air etc to your departure port, all airlines have weight and ‘number of bag’ restrictions. Don’t get caught out – make sure you check the details carefully and be aware of any restrictions. Airlines do charge for oversize or excess baggage. Be prepared, check the restrictions with your travel consultant or the airline carrier directly before you book your flights. Should I book shore excursions or do my own sightseeing? Talk to your HOT travel consultant, it depends on what you want to do. You have options – you can do the shore activities arranged directly by the ship, as the quality and service offered is guaranteed. A bonus, if the tour is delayed the ship will wait for you before it sets sail again. You can, however, book shore excursions, whilst on board, or in advance if you want a more structured adventure. Doing your own local sightseeing can be exciting, however you’ll have to pay close attention to time as the ship will not wait for you if you are running late. What currency is used onboard? This varies depending on cruise line and destination. You can almost guarantee that the currency on most cruise lines will not be in NZD. Ships based in Australia will usually have AUD onboard. Ships that cruise in a variety of destinations will have a currency to reflect their company's ownership, which could be currencies such as USD or Euro. Make sure you ask your HOT travel consultant in advance, so you are prepared. What if I require a special diet? If you have special dietary requirements, you should advise your HOT travel consultant at time of booking. If you do have special requirements, make sure you arrange your meals in advance. However, if you do forget, you can arrange it onboard. What room type should I book? A lot of first-time cruisers choose an inside room (internal without a window) mainly due to the cost. However, it is normally only a small difference per day to upgrade to an oceanview room (with a view). Or investigate an upgrade to a balcony/veranda room which offers floor to ceiling windows that open to allow the fresh ocean air in. Check with your HOT travel consultant Can I take visitors on board? Think of a cruise ship like an airplane. No you can’t. Due to immigration and security reasons only registered guests are permitted onboard at all times. Is there babysitting on board? Babysitting is available at extra cost on some ships. Many cruise lines will offer popular kids club facilities onboard, and some cater better than others. But if you are on a cruise that is targeted at families will be spoilt for choice for ways to entertain the whole family Is there WiFI and mobile reception? Yes you can. Most ships offer Wi-Fi throughout the ship, whilst some only offer in designated areas. Most cruise ships have internet cafes on board. Charges do apply for the use of broadband & because it is based on satellite Phone Reception is generally only available in ports. Some cruise lines have agreements with land-based phone service companies. If you chose to use this service, you will be paying international roaming rates for these calls. Find out before you go – your HOT travel consultant can help How do I pay for on board expenses? Just like many hotels, an onboard account will be set up for you prior to departure. This means all your onboard purchases can be charged to this account. Payment will be made at the end of the cruise. Are there laundry services on board? Laundry and cleaning services are always available. It’s either self-service laundry facilities or a professional laundry service. You will find washing machines, dryers, ironing boards, irons and detergent on board. Self-service washing machines & dryers generally tend to be coin operated. Can I bring alcohol onboard the ship? You are not allowed to bring alcohol onboard the ships. Duty free and personal alcohol purchased onshore will be collected upon your check in and can be collected on the last day of your cruise. Any Duty- and Tax-Free alcohol purchased on the ship will be held for safekeeping and can be collected on the last day of the cruise. Not to worry - cruise lines largely offer drink packages so you can purchase drinks onboard. If not, your drinks can be charged to your cruise card. General cruise questions Can I place a deposit for a cruise booking? At time of booking you can choose to pay for the cruise in full or pay the minimum per person deposit amount. When do I need to pay for my cruise in full? If you have chosen to pay a deposit only, your full payment deadline will be determined by the cruise you book, so please check your Invoice for the final payment due date. What is included in the price of a cruise? Cruise holidays are one of the most value for money holidays you could go on. Your transportation, accommodation and main meals are included whilst onboard. Selected activities and entertainment are also included in the price. There are some additional activities that you may have to pay separately for, like special restaurants & shows. Ask your HOT travel consultant for a full list of inclusions and added extras you can pay for separately Do I need travel insurance? YES – we absolutely recommend that you take out comprehensive travel insurance at the time you book your cruise. Your HOT travel consultant can organise a quick and simple quote for you. Can I book my complete holiday including a cruise? Your local HOT travel consultant will be able to curate you the perfect holiday making sure that it all works like clockwork. We can organise your flights, transfers, an amazing cruise, then accommodation and add in extras like a tour, car hire or sightseeing etc. This is where using a HOT travel consultant is critical – it’s complex and our consultants are expert and making it the best holiday ever. How can I cancel or make changes my cruise booking? We know ‘life’ happens. To cancel your booking, get in contact with your HOT travel consultant as soon as you can. Please note that cancellation fees will apply. Similarly, if you need to make any changes or amendments, we can help, but again, be prepared, change / amendment fees will apply. Some of your booking may be non-refundable. When is my final payment due? Your final payment will be due approximately four to five months before departure. You can find all payment amounts and due dates on your Booking Advice. When will I receive my travel documents? Approximately one to two weeks before your departure date. These documents will be sent directly to your email. If in doubt, ask your HOT travel consultant. You would have already received your online passenger information to complete well in advance. Can I hold a cruise booking? Pricing for cruises is dynamic and is subject to change. Talk to one of our HOT travel consultants and they can talk you through how it can / does work. How do I book a cruise for more than 4 people, or book multiple staterooms? Contact a HOT consultant if you are travelling with more than 4 people, you may need two or more rooms – there are also limitations around the age of children being in rooms by themselves etc –ie; children may not be booked in a room on their own. Children must be accompanied by an adult (over the age of 21) in a room. What if I am cruising with children? There are various restrictions imposed by cruise liners around ages of children travelling. If you are travelling with a child under the age of 12 months, make sure you let your HOT travel consultant know. There are also some restrictions around travelling if you are pregnant and will depend on what stage you are at, again, contact your travel consultant to find out more as these can vary by cruise liner from $ 16,069 per person share twin Lower Deck Balcony Stateroom Flights are additional Enquire now Close options Enquire now Call: 0800 713 715 Book a video call Cruise 11-Nights French Polynesia & the Cook Islands voyage roundtrip from Papeete Enquire now Call: 0800 713 715 Book a video call Quick links Cruises Deals Destinations Flights Holidays Online Brochures Stores & Consultants About HOT Why HOT Careers Email Sign Up Gift Cards Travel insurance Video Appointments Media Centre Help & Support Contact us Help and Support Payment Options Privacy Policy T&Cs - Instore Bookings T&C’s - Online Flight Bookings Website Usage © House of Travel 2004-2024 The House of Travel App Want the insider word on all things travel?
