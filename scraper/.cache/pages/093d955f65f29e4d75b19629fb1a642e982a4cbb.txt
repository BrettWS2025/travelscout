Let the Pura Vida way of life take over as you arrive in San Jose. Trendy Barrio Amon offers a glimpse into the history of the city with colonial mansions converted into art galleries, while Barrio Escalante is a foodie’s paradise and the best place to grab dinner to begin your Costa Rica value tour. Day 2 - San José – Monteverde Tick off San José’s iconic sights with a quick sightseeing tour before travelling towards the creative little town of Sarchí. Seen as the cradle of Costa Rican artisanship, this is the place to buy intricate arts, crafts and souvenirs including the hand-painted and bright coloured oxcart, the national symbol of Costa Rica. The journey continues through the Tilaran Mountain range listening for the collective “oohs” and “aahs” as you enter the mysterious and misty Cloud Forest. Day 3 - Monteverde sightseeing and free time Step into another world on your Costa Rica value tour in a cloud forest reserve. Learn about the thousands of plant and animal species that thrive in this area, many of which only exist right here, from your Travel Director. Keep your ears open for the sounds of hummingbirds, howler monkeys, sloths, toucans, and if you’re really lucky, the Resplendent Quetzal. Leaving the forest on a nature high, you’ll have time to relax this afternoon, or choose from a selection of Choice Experiences, like the ‘El Trapiche’ tour, where you’ll get to visit sugarcane, banana, orange and coffee plantations. Day 4 - Monteverde – Arenal La Fortuna, home to bubbling hot springs, geothermal marvels, and the imposing Arenal Volcano, is one of the true jewels in Costa Rica’s crown. The surrounding landscape teems with tropical flora and fauna, offering opportunities to spot colorful birds, playful monkeys, and even tame iguanas roaming the grounds. After a day of adventure, guests can relax and recharge in a soothing outdoor pool nestled in the heart of this lush paradise. Day 5 - Arenal full day sightseeing Reach new heights at Arenal Hanging Bridges Park, joining a Local Guide for a MAKE TRAVEL MATTER® Experience on a ‘sky walk’ through the jungle canopy. Keep your eyes peeled for colourful birdlife as you cross the suspension bridges. Later, take your pick of Choice Experiences — zip through the rainforest on an adrenaline-pumping canopy tour at Ecoglide Park, or explore La Fortuna’s trails with a Local Guide before making your own tortilla. End the day soaking in blissful hot springs. Day 6 - Arenal sightseeing and free time If a tranquil river float and wildlife search sounds like you, you won’t want to miss this morning’s safari float down the Peñas Blancas River. Paired up with a Local Guide, you’ll love spotting monkeys, sloths, iguanas, caimans and tropical birds. Day 7 - Arenal – Depart San José Your Costa Rica value tour comes to an end this morning. Transfer back to San José International Airport, arriving at approximately 11:00 AM. More Deals Enquire *Terms and Conditions Offer subject to availability at time of booking.
