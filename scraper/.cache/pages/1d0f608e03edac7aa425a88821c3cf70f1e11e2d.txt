Domes and minarets enhance the skyline. In the old Stamboul area, traces remain of every city built since the community was established over 600 years before Christ. Once Rome's eastern capital, Istanbul was also the center of the huge Ottoman Empire. Landmarks include Hagia Sophia, once Christendom's greatest church; the Blue Mosque with its striking Iznik tiles; Topkapi Palace, containing a sultan's ransom of treasures; Chora Church with its Byzantine mosaics; and the Grand Bazaar, the ultimate shopping experience. Day 2: Canakkale, Turkey Canakkale, Turkey June 29, 2026 Arrives: 08:00 AM Departs: 06:00 PM The Turkish city of Canakkale lies along both sides of the Dardanelles strait that links the landlocked Sea of Marmara to the Aegean. Like Istanbul on the Bosphorus — which connects the Marmara to the Black Sea — Canakkale straddles Europe and Asia while also stretching across the history of Western civilization. Indeed, the port has played a pivotal role in everything from the Greek myth of the Golden Fleece to the Gallipoli campaign of World War I. It also serves as your portal back in time to ancient Troy, setting for the epic Trojan War of Homer’s Iliad and a UNESCO World Heritage site. Explore the expansive ruins, tour the impressive museum, and climb inside a 40-foot-high replica of the infamous wooden horse used by the Greeks to enter the city. (Another wooden horse, built for the 2004 movie Troy , stands along Canakkale’s lively waterfront.) You can pay homage at the Gallipoli battlefields, or visit the pretty fishing town of Behramkale, located just below the ancient city of Assos — home to Aristotle’s philosophy academy and another World Heritage site. Day 3: Izmir, Turkey Izmir, Turkey June 30, 2026 Arrives: 08:00 AM Departs: 06:00 PM The magnificent Aegean coast features no shortage of appealing ports of call, and Izmir is a fine example thereof. The birthplace of Homer has grown into a thriving metropolis, filled with fine hotels along its sweeping bay. A fine Archaeology Museum and Ethnography Museum house a multitude of treasures and exhibits, while nearby resorts provide distractions of another sort. Earthquakes and fires over the centuries have obliterated most of ancient Smyrna, as it was once known, but remnants of the 4th-century fort atop Mt. Pagos still provide excellent views of the city and Gulf of Izmir. Day 4: Patmos, Greece Patmos, Greece July 01, 2026 Arrives: 08:00 AM Departs: 05:00 PM Deserted for centuries because of constant raids by pirates and the Turks, this tiny arid island was first settled in 1088 when the Emperor of Constantinople made it a gift to the monk Christodoulos Latrnos so that he could establish a monastery in honor of St. John the Divine on the site. Patmos has been a place of scholarship and religious enlightenment ever since. Today this modern pilgrimage site is a quiet respite from the tourist havens many other Greek isles have become. Day 5: Rhodes, Greece Rhodes, Greece July 02, 2026 Arrives: 08:00 AM Departs: 11:00 PM Best known of the Dodecanese Islands, Rhodes is a fascinating architectural patchwork of her past. Here the legacy of the ancient Greeks mingles with that of besieging Turks, crusading knights, and occupying Italians. Twin bronze deer, the symbol of Rhodes, guard the Mandraki Harbor where the 100-foot Colossus is said to have stood, a wonder of the ancient world. The medieval Crusader City is dominated by the Palace of the Grand Masters, while cobbled streets lead to the bustling bazaar and a lively harbor that is a center of the international yachting scene. Day 6: At Sea At Sea July 03, 2026 Arrives: 12:00 AM Departs: 11:59 PM Day 7: Spetses, Greece Spetses, Greece July 04, 2026 Arrives: 08:00 AM Departs: 05:00 PM Nicknamed “The Isle of the Aromas”, Spetsai is a delight to all of the senses. The island’s historic old town is a yachtsman’s paradise, boasting a stunning harbor, quaint shops and some of the finest restaurants in the Saronic Gulf. The rest of the island is relatively unpopulated and is ringed by a single road, along which you can travel in a horse-drawn carriage. As you pass by quiet, rolling hills, be sure to pause at one of the many quiet coves along the way to refresh yourself with a dip into the cerulean waters. Day 8: Piraeus (Athens), Greece Piraeus (Athens), Greece July 05, 2026 Arrives: 07:00 AM Departs: 05:00 PM Piraeus has been the port for Athens since 482 BC. The busy harbor is filled with ferries and cruise ships making their way to the Greek Islands and other Mediterranean cities. The busy metropolis of Athens and its treasure trove of antiquities lie just a few miles from the port. Even as the reality of the modern city took hold, with its high-rise apartments, crowded sidewalks and bustling traffic, the beauty of the Acropolis, the outstanding museums, charming cafés, sidewalk markets and startling views come together in a cultural mosaic for all to enjoy. Day 9: Gythion (Sparta), Greece Gythion (Sparta), Greece July 06, 2026 Arrives: 08:00 AM Departs: 05:00 PM Gythion, the small port town for Sparta, edges its way up the hillside, which surrounds the harbor. According to Homer, Paris and Helen spent their first night together here, on a tiny islet in the bay. To commemorate the occasion, Paris erected a shrine to Aphrodite, goddess of love, only to have it torn down by the vengeful Menelaus after he recaptured Helen. In its place Menelaus erected statues honoring Praxidica (Punishment) and Themis (Justice). Not far away, at the tip of the Peloponnese, lies the Mani, a distinctive area unlike anything else in Greece. This desolate region of underground lakes and rivers and windswept landscapes is strangely beautiful. To the north of Gythion lie Sparta and Mystra, well worth a visit. Day 10: At Sea At Sea July 07, 2026 Arrives: 12:00 AM Departs: 11:59 PM Day 11: Sarande, Albania Sarande, Albania July 08, 2026 Arrives: 08:00 AM Departs: 05:00 PM This important port on Southern Albania curls around a superb natural harbor, dominated by the hilltop 16th century Lekuresi Castle with distinctive round towers. In the town center are the ruins of a 5th century synagogue, later a Christian basilica, with remnant mosaic floors. Another picturesque ruin is the Forty Saints Monastery from the 6th century, which is thought to have been an important pilgrimage site. But the main attraction in southern Albania is the archaeological site of Butrint, a UNESCO World Heritage Site with extensive ruins of communities dating from prehistory, though the Greek and Roman eras, as well as the Byzantine period, until the medieval period. Day 12: Dubrovnik, Croatia Dubrovnik, Croatia July 09, 2026 Arrives: 08:00 AM Departs: 10:00 PM Founded in the 7th century, Dubrovnik rose to greatness as a merchant state, independent republic and cultural crossroads. The traffic-free Old Town has been called a Croatian Athens. This UNESCO designated World Heritage Site is a living museum of the ages with fortifications, chapels, monastic cloisters and Europe's second-oldest synagogue crowded into its ancient walls. Relax at a sidewalk café, listen to the chimes of the 14th-century bell tower or join the promenade down the palace-lined avenue known as the Stradun. Day 13: Hvar, Croatia Hvar, Croatia July 10, 2026 Arrives: 07:00 AM Departs: 04:00 PM Known as the Queen of the Dalmatian Islands, Hvar is an intriguing medieval town on an island with the same name, and is where celebrities and royalty come to indulge in summer pleasures. It’s considered the sunniest place in Croatia, making it ideal for relaxing days on stunning beaches surrounded by lush forest. The island is also famous for growing the highest quality lavender in the world due to its unique climate, and you’ll be amazed at the intoxicating scent that greets you from the gorgeous fields at the height of blooming season. Hvar is the UNESCO Island, boasting more UNESCO World Heritage sites than any other island in the world. Visit the first public theatre built in all Europe, constructed in 1612 and still standing in the main square of Hvar Town. The Stari Grad Plain, established by the ancient Greeks in 384 BC, features ancient stone walls and shelters bearing testimony to the ancient geometrical system of land division. Hvar today is a quiet spot reminiscent of the French Riviera at the turn-of-the-last-century. Day 14: Koper, Slovenia Koper, Slovenia July 11, 2026 Arrives: 09:00 AM Departs: 06:00 PM Located on the tip of Istria, Slovenia's main port was an island until the 19th century, but local history goes back much further. Called Aegida by the Greeks, Capris by the Romans and Justinopolis in Byzantine times, Koper was the influential city in the Venetian Empire and five mayors sat on the throne of the Venetian doges. Today monuments of this Golden Age line the cobblestone streets of an Old Town that boasts a wealth of architecture, cultural monuments and intriguing shops. Day 15: Fusina (Venice), Italy Fusina (Venice), Italy July 12, 2026 Arrives: 07:00 AM Nestled along the breathtaking Venetian Lagoon, Fusina, Italy, offers a serene escape for discerning travelers seeking a blend of opulence and cultural exploration. This picturesque port town serves as a gateway to the timeless allure of Venice while embodying its own charm and sophistication. Whether immersing oneself in the rich history and artistry of Venice, navigating the iconic canals aboard a private gondola, or savoring the flavors of authentic Italian cuisine in charming trattorias, there is no shortage of unforgettable experiences awaiting visitors.
