Surrounded by breathtaking scenery, you’ll enjoy a rustic wilderness experience in the remote forests of northern Finland—far from the hustle and bustle of everyday life. Check in to your glass-roofed Aurora Cabin, where you’ll spend the next three nights. These unique cabins offer a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to admire the Northern Lights and a sky full of stars from the comfort of your bed. The thermal glass roof ensures clear views even in the coldest temperatures, while the cozy interior and modern amenities provide a warm and comfortable aurora-viewing experience. Each cabin includes a private bathroom. Your escort will meet you this evening in the hotel lobby at 5pm and then enjoy a welcome dinner with your group. Dinner at the restaurant. (D) Day 2: Meet the Reindeer & Snowmobile Safari After breakfast, meet the reindeers. In the old days people used reindeer for transportation. Today you will meet the local reindeers at work, Manu, Pelokas and Papu. Papu will take you for a short reindeer sleigh ride. In a traditional Kota-tent you will have tea, coffee and a small snack by the open fire while our Sámi-reindeer herder tells you stories about reindeer. You can also try your skills at throwing lasso! In the afternoon, join an exciting snowmobile safari. Two persons share one snowmobile and there will be an opportunity to change drivers during the safari. Afterwards, if the skies are clear, head out for a walk to look for the northern lights! Dinner at the restaurant. (B, D) Day 3: Husky Safari & Aurora Hunting After breakfast, prepare for today’s highlight: a thrilling husky safari through breathtaking winter landscapes. Upon arrival at the husky farm, you’ll be provided with a warm thermal outer suit, gloves, and a hat. Then, you’ll be introduced to your very own team of huskies. Before setting off, you’ll receive a briefing on how to drive the sled and how to interpret important hand signals from your guide. Each team consists of approximately six dogs, a driver, and a passenger seated comfortably in a wooden sled. During the safari, you’ll have the opportunity to switch roles so both participants can experience driving and riding. In the evening enjoy aurora hunting by car to spot the Northern Lights. (B,D) Day 4: Sami Cultural Site & Kirkenes After breakfast, transfer by bus to Kirkenes, Norway. This scenic 200-kilometre journey winds past serene lakes and snow-covered forests. Along the way, stop in Inari for lunch and a guided visit to a cultural site dedicated to Sámi heritage. Your guide will provide fascinating insights into the exhibitions, offering a deeper understanding of the rich history, traditions, and way of life of the Sámi people. Upon arrival in Kirkenes, visit the Snowhotel and explore its beautifully hand-crafted snow rooms. You’ll have the chance to admire the intricate ice sculptures and, if you wish, enjoy a drink at the Icebar (additional cost). Afterward, take a short walk to your cozy Gamme Pine Cabin, located within the same resort. In the evening, enjoy a delicious three-course dinner featuring traditional, locally sourced ingredients. After dinner, take a stroll around the Snowhotel grounds, greet the resident reindeer, and—if the skies are clear—keep an eye out for the magical Northern Lights. (B,L,D) Accommodation Gamme Cabins with large oval window, unique wooden design and have all amenities as bathroom with toilet and shower, suitable for 2 persons. Day 5: Embark Cruise This morning, get ready for a totally unforgettable experience on the frozen fjords of Kirkenes. This is your chance to catch, learn how to cook, and most importantly eat the Arctic King Crab. The Arctic King Crab is one of the most sought-after meals in top restaurants, and yet here, you get to eat the best and the freshest, pulled from the fjord in front of your eyes. You all take part in helping to saw the hole in the ice and bring up the catch. You will see how the crab is prepared by your master guide, and you will be taken by snowmobile sled (an experience in itself) to a beautiful farmhouse by the lake. It is here by a cosy log fire that your King Crab meal awaits. Although presentation is simple, the superb, white leg meat and claws with their particularly juicy and naturally sweet taste puts this meal in a league of its own. Warm clothing and a helmet is provided. Please note: This tour is done by snowmobile (the fisherman drives the snowmobile with you in a sled behind the snowmobile), and not by divers or in a boat. Then transfer to the harbour to board the Havila Norwegian Coastal Voyage ship. As the ship starts its voyage south, you can first enjoy lunch then head up to the panorama lounge to enjoy the views of the surrounding Arctic landscape or venture on deck. In the afternoon, the ship again docks at Vardø, Norway’s easternmost port. Continuing south, we cruise along the Varanger peninsula to Båtsfjord, before reaching Berlevåg in the evening. (B,L,D) Transportation Norwegian Coastal Voyage Ship. Accommodation Havila seaview cabin with window with a view of the scenery. Cabins are on average 15 square metres with double bed and sofa, TV, refrigerator, hairdryer and coffee machine. The cabin has a large wardrobe, desk and a separate bathroom with shower. Day 6: Cruise: Hammerfest & Tromsø In the stillness of night, your journey brings you to Mehamn—a quaint fishing village once home to the largest whaling station in all of Finnmark. Though quiet today, its past echoes with maritime history. Next, you’ll arrive in Hammerfest, a town with roots stretching back to the Stone Age. Officially founded in 1789 to foster trade with Russia, Hammerfest soon earned its title as Norway’s Polar Capital, serving as a launch point for daring Arctic hunting expeditions. Don’t miss the Meridian Column, erected in 1854 and now recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Hammerfest has long been a pioneer in energy innovation—back in 1891, it became the first place in Northern Europe to light its streets with electricity powered by wave energy. Today, that legacy continues with a major liquefied natural gas plant just outside town. As you sail south from Øksfjord, crossing open waters, you’ll make a brief stop at the charming island of Skjervøy before gliding into the breathtaking Lyngenfjord, flanked by the dramatic peaks of the Lyngen Alps. Your voyage then leads to Tromsø, where a magical experience awaits: the Midnight Concert at the Arctic Cathedral (Ishavskatedralen) — a serene and unforgettable moment beneath the Arctic sky. (B,L,D) Day 7: Cruise: Lofoten Islands Welcome to the wild and picturesque Lofoten Islands, where dramatic peaks rise above soft white-sand beaches and charming fishing villages. These communities thrive on a strong fishing tradition, and locals still rely on coastal ships for daily travel and transport. Today’s journey takes you through Risøyrenna, a man-made channel that offers a sheltered passage between Harstad and Sortland. As you arrive in Sortland, known as the “Blue City,” you’ll notice buildings painted in various shades of blue—a creative vision brought to life by local artist Bjørn Elvenes, who imagined the town as a living, three-dimensional artwork. Continuing south, the ship appears to glide straight into a wall of mountains—but in fact, you’re entering Raftsundet, a narrow and scenic strait between the Vesterålen and Lofoten islands. If conditions allow, you’ll take a breathtaking detour into Trollfjord, a dramatic fjord with towering cliffs and a chance to spot majestic sea eagles soaring overhead. Your final stops are Svolvær, the main town in the Lofoten archipelago, and Stamsund, where you’ll get a stunning view of the towering Lofoten Wall, a dramatic mountain range that defines the skyline. (B,L,D) Day 8: Cruise - Crossing the Arctic Circle The Helgeland coast in winter is a serene and magical landscape, where snow-dusted islets, frost-covered farmland, and towering granite cliffs create a breathtaking scene. It’s well worth rising early to witness this Arctic wonderland. Today also marks your final day north of the Arctic Circle, which you’ll cross between Ørnes and Nesna — an iconic moment on your voyage. This stretch of coastline is rich in myths and legends. You’ll pass the Seven Sisters, a dramatic row of snow-capped peaks tied to ancient folklore, and Torghatten, the mountain with a mysterious hole said to have been pierced by a magical arrow—its story even more enchanting against a backdrop of winter skies. As you sail from Sandnessjøen to Brønnøysund, you’ll pass the Vega Archipelago, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Even in winter, the islands tell a story of harmony between people and nature. For centuries, locals have protected nesting eider ducks in exchange for their precious down, a tradition that continues to this day. Your day ends in Brønnøysund, a cozy and lively town that glows under the soft winter light. Take a peaceful walk along Havnegata, where boats rest quietly in the harbour and the crisp air carries the scent of the sea. The snow-covered archipelago adds a quiet charm to this vibrant coastal community. (B,L,D) Day 9: Cruise - Molde, Kristiansund & Trondheim Today offers another chance to explore the historic city of Trondheim. A must-see is the Nidaros Cathedral, Scandinavia’s largest medieval structure. This grand cathedral has witnessed the coronation of three queens and seven kings, and its gothic spires are especially striking against the winter sky. Further along the coast lies Kristiansund, perched along the scenic Atlantic Road. Known as Norway’s klipfisk capital for its long-standing tradition of exporting dried and salted cod, the town has a unique maritime charm. While here, consider visiting the Atlantic Road itself — one of Norway’s most iconic and photogenic routes, especially dramatic in winter with waves crashing against the winding bridges. As you continue your journey, you’ll pass the islands of Munkholmen and Hitra, crossing open sea toward Molde. Often called the “City of Roses,” Molde’s mild Gulf Stream climate gives it a surprisingly lush feel, even in winter. As you depart, look to the horizon for the jagged silhouettes of the Romsdal Alps, their snow-covered peaks rising sharply against the fading light. (B,L,D) Day 10: Western Islands & disembark in Bergen As your voyage comes towards the end, you pass Ålesund, Torvik and Måløy during the night and in the morning you might want to enjoy the last leg of your journey seeing the picturesque Nordfjord below the enormous Jostedalsbreen glacier, Norway's longest fjord- the mighty Sognefjord and the gorgeous Bergen Archipelago. After checking into the hotel, meet your city guide and enjoy a 3-hour walking tour of Bergen, including the famous Bryggen, the old Hanseatic Quarter. In the evening we will enjoy a special farewell dinner and toast your trip with your fellow group members! (B,L,D) Day 11: Depart After breakfast, transfer on your own to the airport.
