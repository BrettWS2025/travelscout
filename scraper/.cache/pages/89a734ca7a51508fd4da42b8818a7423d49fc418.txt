Your adventure begins in Mexico City, where you’ll be met at the airport and transferred to your hotel. Meet your group and local leader at a welcome meeting at 6 pm tonight. Your hotel in Mexico City is housed in a building built in the 1890s and the location is one of the city’s best. The buzzing Zocalo Plaza and the National Cathedral are right on your doorstep and you can see views from the hotel’s rooftop restaurant and bar. After your meeting, head out for dinner with your leader and sample an array of local dishes. End the evening with some sweet treats at the city’s oldest churreria. Day 2: Mexico City Today, you’ll get to know Mexico City on a tour with your knowledgeable local leader. From cosmopolitan glamour to ancient history, there’s a lot to see, so rise early and head out to the National Museum of Anthropology where your leader will indicate the most interesting rooms so you can walk through the different stages of the country’s past. Continue to the Zocalo Plaza, the lively main square of the city. Visit the National Cathedral to hear its story and see the impressive Baroque architecture, then stop at Diego Riviera Museo Mural where you can appreciate one of his most famous works. We will also visit Gastromotiva, an Intrepid Foundation partner who fight hunger and food insecurity across Latin America. Tonight is free to seek out the best food – your leader will have the best local recommendations. Day 3: Puebla Depart Mexico City and travel to Teotihuacan. Here, you'll discover the extraordinary ruins known as the Pyramid of the Sun and the Pyramid of the Moon, which dominate the skyline. This was once the biggest city in the Americas and predates the Aztec Empire by many centuries. Join an expert local guide and stroll down The Avenue of the Dead to see fascinating clues as to what life here was like nearly 2000 years ago. After lunch continue to Puebla. Stop off on the way to visit a local family who produce beautiful stonework carved form obsidian – a naturally occurring volcanic glasslike rock. Take some time to admire their striking pieces and speak to the family about their craft. Arrive in Puebla and set out for a walk around town, visiting Calle de los Dulces (Candy Street) and the El Parian handicraft market. See the Rosary Chapel and Town Hall Palace, then head out to dinner at an award-winning restaurant, where a local chef serves up local specialties in an elegant setting – the mole here comes highly recommended. Day 4: Puebla After breakfast, get to know Cholula, a city close to Puebla, by joining your leader on an orientation walk. As Cholula has the most churches in Mexico, you’ll stop at a few on your journey, like Santuario de la Virgen de los Remedios, located on the top of the Great Pyramid of Cholula. Walk to the church overlooking the site for views of the excavated areas around the pyramid and learn how the structure was built to honour the great Popocatépetl volcano. For lunch today, stop off at a restaurant serving up organic dishes made with locally sourced produce to minimise their impact on the environment. The rest of the day is free for your own explorations. Day 5: Oaxaca Today, you’ll make the journey to Oaxaca – a colourful city rich with history and culture. Arrive in the late afternoon and settle into your hotel for the next three nights – converted from a 19th-century mansion, traditional charm emanates from every corner, from its ivy-clad courtyard to original frescoes and stone fountain. Just a stone’s throw away from the city’s main Zocalo, full of cafes, musicians and artisans, there’s no better base for your time in Oaxaca. Head out for an orientation walk with your leader to get a feel for the city, stopping by the local markets of Benito Juarez and 20 de Noviembre for a classic Oaxacan lunch, then enjoy a free evening. The best way to get to the heart of Oaxaca’s culture is to taste its food, so your leader will be happy to offer up some great local recommendations for dinner. Day 6: Oaxaca Today, venture out of the city and take a tour of the Oaxaca region. Visit the Mitla ruins archaeological site – once the religious centre for Zapotec communities – and the Tule Tree, considered the world’s widest tree at over 11 m in diameter. The Montezuma cypress’ gnarled trunk is over 1500 years old, roughly the same as the ruins. Stop off to try some Mexican ice cream – an important part of Mexico’s culinary history, this hand-churned ice cream is considered one of the tastiest in the world. Maybe try some traditional Beso Oaxaqueno – a fresh fruit sorbet – or a scoop seasoned with chili. Continue to a beeswax candle-making workshop, learning age-old processes passed down for generations and the intricate designs that are created. Later, take part in a Zapotec weaving demonstration, which uses only traditional techniques, tools, patterns and organic dyes. Watch as local families craft folk clothing and rugs, some taking months to complete. Here, you’ll have a mostly plant-based lunch of regional specialities. On your way back to Oaxaca, stop by an agave mezcal factory for a tasting before returning to the city in the late afternoon. Day 7: Oaxaca Enjoy a free day to take in the sights, sounds and tastes of Oaxaca. There’s something here to suit every interest – speak to your leader about arranging a visit to the Monte Alban archaeological site, take a local cooking class or opt for a street art cycling tour. Tonight, head to a special dining experience with a menu of traditional Oaxacan dishes, curated and cooked by the restaurant’s award-winning owner and inspired by the recipes of her mother and grandmother. Let the dishes take you on a trip around the state as you enjoy a multi-course meal. Day 8: Playa Del Carmen This morning catch an unescorted to Playa del Carmen – a coastal resort town on the Yucatan Peninsula, known for its turquoise waters and nightlife. You’ll be met at Cancun International Airport and transferred to your hotel. This evening there will be a second group meeting with your new local leader and group. If you arrive early, you might like to stroll along pedestrian avenue while perusing handmade hammocks, jewellery and crafts. After your meeting, you’ll head to a local restaurant and sit down for a traditional feast of fresh fish, mussels, shrimp and clams. The Yucatan’s bountiful Caribbean coastline means it’s home to some of the freshest seafood in the country. Day 9: Valladolid After breakfast, depart Playa del Carmen and head to the secluded Laguna Chabela. Here, you’ll meet a local Maya family who have lived here for generations. Gain a deeper understanding of their way of life as you walk through the low jungle full of medicinal plants, see what they grow and learn how they live off the land. Watch a demonstration on how to make delicious tortillas in the Coba style with the family matriarch then sit down to a traditional lunch prepared by hand using a mortar and pestle found in the nearby ruins, still used after 1000 years. You’ll feel like you’ve travelled back in time, with stones from ancient Maya structures emerging from the jungle and the sounds of birds as your backdrop. In the afternoon, continue to the city of Valladolid, known for its pastel-coloured buildings. Set on the city’s main square, your hotel was converted from a 16th century house and offers a perfect base for your explorations. Day 10: Merida - Chichen Itza This morning will be spent exploring the complex of Chichen Itza. Named as one of the new Seven Wonders of the World, Chichen Itza is considered the most important archaeological vestige of the Maya-Toltec civilisation in Yucatan by UNESCO. Meet with a local guide for a tour to uncover the secrets of what is perhaps the most famous Maya site, dominated by the Temple of Kukulkan, or El Castillo – a Mesoamerican step-pyramid. After, you’ll have a home-cooked lunch with a local family in the town of Piste. Tuck into a traditional Pibil feast – a Maya style of cooking that involves barbecuing underground, which the family have perfected over generations. After lunch, visit a local cenote for a swim. These limestone sinkholes were viewed by the Maya as doorways to the underworld. Continue to Merida – founded in 1542, this city is the Yucatan capital and retains much of its old-world charm. Your Feature Stay accommodation for the next three evenings is in the historic Hotel Casa Lucia. Spacious rooms feature traditional touches, surrounding a courtyard hat features a swimming pool. Day 11: Merida This morning, you’ll join your leader on a walking tour of downtown Merida to learn more about the Maya heritage of the town. Visit the market for a look at local life and stop by the city museum, Montejo's House and the cathedral. Step inside the Palacio del Gobierno to admire the murals by Fernando Castro Pacheco – a famous Mexican artist from Merida. The paintings depict the history of the city and interactions between the Maya and the Spanish. The afternoon is free for further discoveries – you might like to relax in the green and shady Plaza Grande or browse the outdoor market selling Maya replicas. Regroup for dinner at a local restaurant serving up Yucatan specialties – the sopa da lima (lime soup) is especially delicious here. Day 12: Merida After breakfast, you’ll head out for another Exclusive Experience at the Celestun Bird Sanctuary and Biosphere Reserve. One of the first places migratory birds arrive for the winter, the reserve offers a birdwatching experience like no other. Tour the area by small boat while you learn about its unique flora and fauna. Look out for the Yucatan woodpecker, Mexican sheartail, tropical mockingbird and depending on the season (usually December to March), you might witness the thousands of flamingos streaking across the landscape. Hop off the boat for a quick walk to view bubbling springs then cruise back through the mangrove canals. Stop in a fishing town for some time for lunch – maybe grab some fresh seafood and eat it with your toes in the sand. Take a dip in the Gulf of Mexico before returning to Merida for a free afternoon. Day 13: Tulum Depart Merida this morning and head towards Muyil, stopping off for lunch in the village of Coba. Continue to the virtually unknown Muyil Archaeologic Site – this ancient Maya trading post is one of the oldest once-inhabited sites in the country, with a history stretching back to 350 BC. Explore the ruins with your leader who will explain what life here once looked like. Next, head to the banks of the Maya River and board a small boat to explore the canals and lagoons of the Sian Ka'an biosphere. One of the largest protected areas in Mexico, this UNESCO World Heritage site covers more than 400,000 hectares of land, lagoon and marine areas, including countless flora and fauna. You’ll be joined by guides from the local community who will help you get the most out of this experience. Admire the ruins on the riverbanks before disembarking in the waters of the ancient Mayan mangrove canals, where you’ll experience a natural ‘lazy river’ and float through the peaceful canals in a slow but steady current. After 45 minutes of floating, carry on to Tulum. Day 14: Tulum In the morning, head to the Tulum archaeological site and learn about the history of the ruins and their views of the ocean. One of the last cities built by the Maya, your leader will paint a picture of how life played out here as you explore the complex against the ocean backdrop. Spend the afternoon soaking up the sun at a beach club, where you can swim in the Caribbean Sea or nap in a comfortable lounge chair. Tonight, dine at one of Tulum’s best restaurants. With laid back vibes and inspired by the freshest local produce and seafood, this final dinner with your newfound friends will certainly be one to remember. Day 15: Tulum Your adventure comes to an end after breakfast this morning. If you would like to spend some more time in Tulum, just speak to your booking agent ahead of time to organise additional accommodation.
