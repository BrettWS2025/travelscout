Itinerary The Canadian Rockies are known for their stunning scenery, rugged mountains, breathtaking glaciers, mighty rivers, and gorgeous national parks. On this Heart of the Canadian Rockies tour, you'll experience all of this and more! You'll overnight in Calgary, Banff National Park, Jasper National Park, Kamloops, Victoria, and Vancouver. In Banff National Park, Canada's oldest national park and gateway to the Canadian Rockies, you'll have time on your own to stroll along the river, explore the hot springs and quaint shops, and also take an optional excursion to view the incredible scenery by helicopter. You'll also enjoy two nights in Jasper National Park, the largest national park in the Canadian Rockies. You can hike, peruse the shops, and join an optional excursion to see beautiful Maligne Lake and Spirit Island. Between Banff and Jasper, you'll experience a highlight of this Canadian Rockies tour-a thrilling ride aboard an Ice Explorer all-terrain vehicle to the Athabasca Glacier, part of the Columbia Icefield, the largest expanse of ice in the Canadian Rockies. Your journey also includes a stop in Lake Louise, whose turquoise waters create a natural mirror that reflects the surrounding mountains and pristine wilderness. This tour also includes ferry crossings between Vancouver and Victoria as well as sightseeing in both. In Victoria, your sightseeing includes world-famous Butchart Gardens with its 55 acres of showcase floral displays. You'll also have free time in Victoria to explore on your own. Perhaps enjoy high tea at the Empress Hotel, walk and discover Victoria's delightful historic buildings and harbour, or take the optional Marine Wildlife & Whale-Watching Expedition to seek out the resident pods of orca whales. All of this and more await you on this once-in-a-lifetime Canadian Rockies tour designed for savvy, value-minded travelers! Show more Day 1 CALGARY Welcome to Calgary!
