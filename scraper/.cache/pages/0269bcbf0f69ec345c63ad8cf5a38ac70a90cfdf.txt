Spend some time exploring the charming city or its picturesque surroundings. For a more adventurous experience, consider a day trip to the rugged Tierra del Fuego archipelago, renowned for its dramatic landscapes, including snow-capped peaks, glaciers, flower-filled meadows, and boggy marshlands. In the afternoon, board your ship and embark on your journey. Your adventure begins navigating the tranquil Beagle Channel, a strait located in the Tierra del Fuego Archipelago. Days 2 & 3: At Sea - Crossing the Drake Passage You will continue your journey by crossing the famous Drake Passage, where the cold Antarctic waters meet the warmer Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Known for its challenging conditions and strong westerly winds, the Drake Passage is a notable achievement for sailors. Rest assured, your expedition vessel is equipped with stabilisers, powerful engines, and a skilled crew to ensure a comfortable crossing. As you traverse the Drake Passage, keep an eye out for the first signs of Antarctic wildlife, including seals and penguins. This area is also renowned for its diverse birdlife. Days 4 & 5: South Shetland Islands Over the next two days, you will dive into the Antarctic adventure that explorers of the past could only dream of. You will explore the sub-Antarctic islands of the South Shetland chain, encountering breathtaking landscapes along the way. Weather permitting, your planned landfalls include King George Island, Deception Island (an extinct volcano with waters warm enough for a polar swim), and Half Moon Island, home to nesting Wilson's storm petrels and chinstrap penguins. The exact itinerary and activities will depend on weather and ice conditions, and will be communicated by the captain and expedition leader during regular briefings. Days 6 & 7: Antarctica As Antarctica comes into view, the presence of wildlife becomes increasingly apparent, with numerous penguins, seals, nesting birds, and marine mammals. Your route will take you to notable spots along the Antarctic Peninsula, including Cuverville Island (home to leopard, fur, and Weddell seals), Gerlache Strait (known for humpback whales), Paradise Bay, and the dramatic Lemaire Channel, where orcas may be spotted. The exact itinerary will depend on weather and ice conditions, with the captain and expedition leader providing updates through regular briefings. Please note that all landings and outings are subject to favourable weather, sea, and ice conditions to ensure the safety of all passengers and staff. During inclement weather or downtime, your ship offers comfortable public areas such as a wellness/sauna, restaurant, bar, and library. The expert staff will also provide engaging lectures on topics ranging from exploration history to biology, geology, ice, and wildlife. Days 8 & 9: Departing Antarctica You will depart Antarctica and spend two days at sea as you make your way back to Ushuaia, crossing the Drake Passage and cruising past Cape Horn, a legendary maritime landmark and the southern tip of South America. Onboard, enjoy various activities, socialise with fellow travellers, attend lectures by your expedition team, visit the ship’s shop, or relax in the ship’s comfortable facilities.
