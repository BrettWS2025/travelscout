Think world-famous waterfalls, drool-inducing cuisine and a feverish passion for soccer that pulses across all its cities. The fiestas are loud, the dancing’s dramatic and nobody goes to bed before sunrise. South America is one mixed-bag of diverse treasures - you’ll find famed vineyards and ruby-red Malbec in Argentina, alpacas in Machu Picchu and Christ the Redeemer in Rio. In Colombia, play tejo, a game that tests your throwing accuracy. Bolivia offers you an insight into the still practiced art of witchcraft and across many countries, swap your English Breakfast tea for a cup of ‘mate tea’. If you can get to a ranch and see a famed South American cowboy (referred to as a gaucho in the local lingo), you’ll be seriously impressed at their horsemanship. And one of the best meals on the planet has to be an asado - a very delicious BBQ type meal. Embrace the change in language and the later nights. Take your time when out and about and enjoy the slower pace of life. Embrace the change in language and the later nights. Take your time when out and about and enjoy the slower pace of life. Connect with one of our South America specialists to create your dream holiday, today! Flight time. Flying from Auckland to Santiago offers a direct service, meaning your flight time is just around 11 hours non-stop. Best time to go. For South America, the best time to visit the Southern Cone is during their summer (November to March). Brazil is best to visit during the dry season (May to September). Peru and Bolivia is best during the dry season (May to October). Ecuador and Galapagos Islands is best from June to November. Time difference. South America spans several time zones, but most countries are around 15 to 17 hours behind New Zealand Standard Time (NZST, GMT +12).
