The journey from the airport to your hotel will take approximately 45 minutes and is an entertaining experience full of chaotic traffic, distinctive architecture and overloaded motorbikes. Ho Chi Minh City, formally Saigon, is a city of bright neon lights, endless shopping and trendy cafes. Its wide tree-lined boulevards reflect its French heritage, and towering skycrapers announce it has landed squarely in the 21st Century. As a contrast to this modern backdrop is the chaotic traffic of swarming motorbikes which are generally overloaded or carrying exotic passengers. This is people watching at its best. Day 2: Ho Chi Minh City This morning you will be met at your hotel at 7.30am for the journey west from Ho Chi Minh City to Cu Chi. Once in Vietnam, you must visit this spot. This is where guerilla warfare optimized and exemplified. You’ll learn the clever design of the tunnels and the strategic use of trap doors. Even with B-52 bombers dropping 30-ton loads of explosive, turning the jungle into a pockmarked moonscape, 30 thousand American troops failed to conquered the area! You’ll have a chance to crawl around a portion of the 121 km long, multiple-layered tunnel. You’ll learn how thousands of guerrillas managed to stay underground many days at a time, also their great technique to conceal smoke from their cooking. There’re a lot more to enjoy, even a chance to fire real AK bullets. Lunch at local restaurant near Cu Chi. After lunch, we go back to Ho Chi Minh City for a City tour around. With over eight million inhabitants and four million motorbikes, Ho Chi Minh City is truly a city that never sleeps. Despite its modernity, Ho Chi Minh City maintains a strong link to the past and our city tour takes in some of Ho Chi Minh City's most historic landmarks including the Notre Dame Cathedral, a red brick edifice with twin spires constructed from materials imported from France (entrance is only permitted when no services are being performed). Then head across the square to the Central Post Office, completed in 1891. A short drive away is the former Presidential Palace, the headquarters of the Ho Chi Minh Government during the American War. Continue to the War Remnants Museum for a vivid perspective of the American War through the eyes of the Vietnamese. (Please note that some of the displays are very graphic.) Experience Ho Chi Minh City's famed street coffee culture while your guide provides a brief language lesson as well as insights into daily life of a Saigonese before returning to your hotel. The evening is yours at leisure. (B, L) Day 3: Ho Chi Minh City - Hoi An This morning you have free time at your leisure unitl our driver meets you at your hotel and transfers you to Ho Chi Minh airport for a short flight to Da Nang.

The next stop is Phuc Kien Assembly Hall. The Phuc Kien (Fukien) Assembly Hall at 46 Tran Phu St is dedicated to Thien Hau, goddess of the sea. The last visit of our tour is Tan Ky ancient house. The house is not the oldest in Hoi An yet but its architecture is among one the most typical.
