Hot feature: Taste your way through Montmartre. Nibble flaky pastries, savour gooey cheeses and sip wine so good you’ll be wondering if Paris bottled a little bit of magic just for you. Show more Day 1 London (England) First stop, London. Touch down in London Town: drop your bags and meet the fellow travellers you'll be sharing the next two-and-a-half weeks with. Whether you’re fresh off a long-haul flight or thrumming with excitement, chances are you'll be chatting like old friends in no time. First night, British bites: London's food scene is a global melting pot - but tonight, you’re going classic. Our welcome dinner is your crash course in British comfort food: think fish and chips with a twist, seasonal pies, sticky toffee pudding and maybe a cheeky pint or mocktail to toast the trip ahead. Later, your way: jet lag calling? Head back to the hostel for a well-earned rest. Still buzzing? Follow your curiosity down cobbled streets to a cosy pub or catch the glow of the city on a twilight stroll past the Thames. Whatever pace you're feeling, London’s got you. Day 2 London - Paris (France) Next stop: Paris! Next stop: Paris: this morning, you’re saying au revoir to London and hopping on the Eurostar. In just over two hours, you’ll glide into Paris Gare du Nord - no airport faff required. Sit back, relax and get excited: the City of Light awaits. A dreamy Parisian arrival: after check-in, wander the local streets to pick up some picnic essentials - think fresh baguettes, gooey cheese, strawberries and maybe a cheeky bottle of wine. You’ll then head to the Seine for a river cruise with a difference: dinner on deck (if there’s time), city views and golden-hour magic as the Eiffel Tower twinkles into view. Day 3 Paris Get ready to fall for Paris. Pedals before pastries: if you're up for it, start your morning with an optional bike tour through Paris - a breezy way to see the sights and feel the city's rhythm before the crowds wake up. Sweet strolls and savoury surprises: in the afternoon, meet your Trip Leader in Montmartre for a walking tour through one of Paris’s most charming (and photo-worthy) neighbourhoods. Along the way, you’ll nibble on a flaky croissant, bite into a rich éclair and if you're feeling brave - give escargot (that’s snails to the uninitiated) a go. You’ll wrap things up with sweeping views from the Sacré-Cœur. Paris never looked so good. Day 4 Paris Paris, your way. Royal detour: fancy a glimpse of grandeur? Join an optional day trip to the Palace of Versailles - all gold, gardens and over-the-top glamour. It’s a chance to step into a time of big wigs (and even bigger egos) and channel your inner Marie Antoinette (cake optional). Paris, your way: staying in the city? Make the most of it. Brave the crowds and snap a selfie at the Eiffel Tower, wander past the gothic beauty of Notre-Dame or lose yourself in the Louvre among da Vinci and friends. Whether you're ticking off the icons or sipping espresso at a pavement café, the day is yours. A night to remember: this evening, regroup for a delicious included dinner with your fellow travellers - ending with full bellies and happy chatter. Still in the mood to celebrate? An optional cabaret show awaits, feathers, flair and all. Day 5 Paris - Swiss Alps (Switzerland) Au revoir Paris, hello alpine air. All aboard to the Alps: today’s a big travel day - you’ll be journeying from Paris to the Swiss Alps, and yes, it’s a long one (around seven hours), so get comfy. It’s your cue to doze, daydream, or finally finish that podcast you started in 2021... Alpine welcome: after check-in, you’ll regroup for a cosy included dinner - the perfect intro to your new alpine life. Crisp air, hearty food, and snowy peaks on the horizon? You’ve officially arrived. Day 6 Swiss Alps Sky-high adventures or serene Swiss scenes. Adventure? Your call: today’s all yours to soak up the Swiss Alps however you like. Feeling bold? Take on the Jungfrau excursion - Europe’s highest train station with views that’ll stop you in your tracks. Or, if you're chasing an adrenaline rush, how about a helicopter skydive over Lauterbrunnen? Prefer to keep your feet (mostly) in the air? A scenic glacier helicopter ride offers jaw-dropping views without the freefall. Whether you're thrill-seeking or just wandering through alpine beauty, this day’s about making your Swiss dreams happen. Day 7 Swiss Alps - Florence (Italy) Cruise from cool heights to warm Italian nights. From peaks to piazzas: it’s time to swap snow-capped mountains for Tuscan sunshine. Today you’ll be travelling from the Swiss Alps to Florence - so settle in and start dreaming about gelato. It’s a long ride, but trust us: Florence is worth the wait. Buona sera, Firenze: after check-in, take a deep breath - you’re in the heart of Italy now. Crumbling churches, Renaissance art, and the sort of pasta that will give all others an inferiority complex. Day 8 Florence Renaissance sights and Tuscan bites. Florence on foot (and with a fork): this morning, join a local guide for a walking tour through the cradle of the Renaissance. You’ll pass Duomo domes, piazzas buzzing with life, and statues that have watched centuries of whispered gossip and grand gestures unfold. We’ll break up the sightseeing with a stop at one of Florence’s most drool-worthy sandwich joints - crusty bread, salty-sweet cured meats, bold Tuscan spreads. It’s not just lunch, it’s a full sensory experience. You’ll eat it like the locals do: standing up, sunshine on your face, and olive oil dripping down your fingers (and probably your shoes - no regrets). Salute to Florence: in the evening, keep the fun going with an optional Tipsy Tour. You’ll stroll through the city’s golden-hour glow while sipping your way through traditional Tuscan drinks - from spritzes and Chianti to a cheeky shot of something local you probably can’t pronounce. It’s culture, but with a buzz. Day 9 Florence - Rome Arrivederci Florence, buongiorno Rome. Next stop: the Eternal City: this morning, you’ll board a high-speed train from Florence to Rome - sleek, smooth and city-to-city in under two hours. Sit back and watch Tuscany roll by your window before we arrive in Italy’s ancient heart. Roaming in Rome: after check-in, your Trip Leader will take you on a welcome walk to get your bearings - and your first taste of the city (literally). We’ll be sampling a couple of slices of classic Roman pizza and grabbing a scoop (or two) of gelato. It’s a relaxed intro to the buzzing streets, crumbling ruins and carb-filled charm that make Rome unforgettable. Day 10 Rome Rome’s a-ready for you. When in Rome: today’s all yours to dive into the magic of Rome at your own pace. Toss a coin into the Trevi Fountain, climb the Spanish Steps, stand in awe beneath the Pantheon’s dome, or wander through the ancient ruins of the Roman Forum. Heads up - these are some of Rome’s biggest hotspots, so expect a buzz of fellow travellers and lively crowds. Dive deep into Rome's storied past: join an optional guided tour of the Colosseum and step inside the world’s most iconic arena. Gladiators not included. Pasta like a pro: this evening, you’ll regroup for a hands-on pasta-making class - where you’ll roll, shape and sauce your way to a delicious homemade dinner. It’s fresh, fun and very Roman. Buon appetito! Day 11 Rome La dolce vita! Your Roman holiday, your rules: today’s a free day to uncover more of Rome’s endless charm however you please. Sip espresso in sun-drenched piazzas, wander cobbled laneways in search of the perfect vintage postcard, or just befriend every stray cat you meet. Step inside the Vatican: if you're up for it, join the optional Vatican tour - where you’ll crane your neck at the Sistine Chapel ceiling, try to wrap your head around just how much gold is in St. Peter’s Basilica, and take in a mind-boggling amount of art, stories and sheer spectacle. Eat like a local: dive into Rome’s culinary scene on the optional food tour - a tasty journey through markets, trattorias, and gelato spots where you’ll probably come away with seven new favourites. Choosing just one? Impossible. It’s like picking a favourite child… if your children were made of ice cream. Day 12 Rome - Venice From ruins to canals - Venice, here we come! A first taste: after you arrive, fall in love with Venice’s labyrinth of narrow streets and shimmering waterways on a welcome walk. Then, glide through the city’s iconic canals with an included gondola ride - a classic Venetian experience that’s as dreamy as it sounds. Dinner together: as evening falls, gather with your group for an included dinner overlooking shimmering canals or twinkling rooftops. Then prepare for the magic of Venice after dark. Day 13 Venice Venice, uncovered. Venice, your way: today’s all yours to uncover the city’s hidden corners and timeless charm. Lose yourself in the magical chaos of Libreria Acqua Alta - the famous bookshop where books stack like gondolas to survive the acqua alta floods. Wander through the historic Jewish Ghetto, a neighbourhood rich in stories and character. Or visit Ca’ Rezzonico, a stunning palace turned museum that offers a glimpse into Venice’s lavish past. Glass and colours: fancy a day on the water? Head out to Murano and Burano islands to explore Murano’s legendary glass-making workshops and the rainbow-hued houses of Burano. It’s a feast for the eyes and the perfect way to see Venice beyond the main canals. Day 14 Venice - Munich (Germany) Next stop: Munich! All aboard for alpine awe: today, you’ll travel from Venice to Munich on a direct scenic train through the stunning Brenner Pass. As you glide along the Brenner Railway, get ready for jaw-dropping views of snow-capped Alps, lush valleys and hillside towns (the ultimate Instagram scroll-stopper). Later, your way: when the travelling’s done, it’s time to dive into Munich’s legendary beer scene. Hunt down a cozy biergarten, grab a stein of frothy lager and treat yourself to some crispy currywurst (meaty or plant-based!).
