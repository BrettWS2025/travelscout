Day 2: At Sea Your day at sea today is an invitation to unwind in the most serene setting imaginable. Let the gentle caress of the sea breeze and the soothing sounds of the waves become your sanctuary of relaxation. Whether basking in the warmth of the sun on the deck, indulging in a rejuvenating spa treatment, or enjoying a cocktail as the sun dips below the waterline, each moment is a peaceful retreat into tranquillity. The sea becomes a haven where stresses fade away, replaced by a sense of calm and rejuvenation that only the open water can provide. Here, amidst the boundless beauty of the ocean, you will find the perfect blend of relaxation and bliss on your cruise journey. Day 3: Wajima, Noto Peninsula Your discovery begins along the north-western coast of the main island of Honshu: experience the colourful hustle and bustle at the morning market in Wajima or explore the rugged Noto Peninsula with its ancient, terraced rice fields (additional charge). Day 4: Oki Islands Both geology and the remote location have created a very special ecosystem on the Oki Islands, characterised by red rock formations and green vegetation. Enjoy the constantly changing views of the sea from the 257-metre-tall Matengai Cliff on a hike along the Kuniga Coast (additional charge). Alternatively, you can visit Takuhi Shrine (additional charge) or explore the islands by bus and boat (additional charge). Day 5: Sakaiminato Sakaiminato is famous for the whimsical bronze figures of the manga artist Mizuki Shigeru, who was born here. Daisen-Oki National Park looks like something from a Japanese ink painting – for example, with the “twin” of Mount Fujiyama – scenes that you can enjoy while hiking on Mount Daisen (additional charge). More optional activities (at additional charge): The Izumo Taisha Grand Shrine is considered one of the most important Shinto shrines. This is where newlyweds pray for a happy marriage and single people wish for a partner. Visit the old samurai town of Matsue, which has retained its original character. With a castle from the 17th century and the private Adachi Museum of Art – a remarkable collection of paintings and ceramics set amidst a beautiful Japanese garden. Day 6: Busan, South Korea Arrive in the fascinating realm of Busan, South Korea. From here, you can enjoy a coastal hike through Igidae Park and get immersed in nature. You can let your senses revel in a Korean cookery course where at the largest fish market in the country, you will discover typical food and ingredients with which you will prepare Korean “fire meat” bulgogi (additional charge). Day 7: Jeju Island, South Korea Pure nature: the best way to get to know the landscape of Jeju Island with its volcanic peaks and lava tunnels, which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is on an island tour or a walk to the crater rim of the Sangumburi Crater (additional charge). Day 8: Nagasaki Back in Japan, Nagasaki will first tell you its moving story. But you will not only learn about the events around 1945 – the focus will also be on the country’s oldest stone bridge and the oldest Christian church. Geishas are a symbol of traditional Japanese culture. The lifestyle and duties of this “person of the arts” will be explained to you personally during an authentic Japanese lunch in the company of a geisha (additional charge). Day 9: Yakushima In the southwest of Japan, the Nansei Islands are lined up over an area of 1000 km2 as the “South Seas of Japan”. Yakushima boasts a lush tropical landscape and ancient, mossy cedar forest. There are excellent hiking opportunities here, such as trekking in Shiratani-Unsuikyo National Park (additional charge). Day 10: Uwajima Great natural wonders and cultural treasures also characterise the smallest of Japan’s main islands, Shikoku. Surrounded by mountain ranges, a historic castle in the coastal town of Uwajima will transport you back to the Edo period. Explore cultural Uwajima in the footsteps of the Date clan who once ruled here. You will also gain insights into the tradition of the terraced fields of Yusu – the only agricultural option in the mountain region. Alternatively, a visit to the old town of Uchiko, a centre of wax and candle production in the 20th century, is like a journey back in time (additional charge). Day 11: At Sea Today you will enjoy your second day at sea during your cruise. Day 12: Shimizu Today you can uncover the secret of green tea from the premiere destination Shimizu or make the most of Japan’s landmark – Mount Fuji – is also rich in symbolism and legends (additional charge). Will the weather reveal the white peak to you, 3776 metres high? Let’s hope so. Day 13: Tokyo Explore Tokyo, the mega-metropolis with its buildings that reach for the sky. A city of contrasts with its imperial palace, small temples, ornate shrines, and lively markets. You can take a walk exploring Japanese gardens and art or enjoy the high life on a visit to Japan’s highest tower – the Tokyo Skytree (additional charge). Day 14: At Sea Today you will have time to relax and enjoy the cruise until you arrive to your next destination. Day 15: Miyako Near Miyako, Sanriku-Fukko National Park with its magnificent flora and fauna will show you unique natural wonders. Your motto for the day: you can actively discover Japan – on a coastal hike along rugged cliffs, in the Ryusendo limestone cave, or by boat along the impressive coast of the Kitayamazaki Cliffs (additional charge). Day 16: Okushiri Off the northernmost main island of Japan, Hokkaido, you will reach the rugged, small rocky island of Okushiri, famous for abalone shells and sea urchins. If the authorities give the green light, you will explore the nature of the island with your experts. In good weather, the Zodiacs will be used. And then that will be it – you will have completed your circumnavigation of Japan. Driven by curiosity and a pioneering spirit, this cruise will reward you with a unique wealth of experiences in the Far East.
