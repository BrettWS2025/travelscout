Take a walk through its grand past, dynamic present and exciting future, from the maze of streets that once nurtured great artists in Montmartre to the Eiffel Tower before joining your Travel Director and fellow travellers this evening. Day 2 - Paris Sightseeing and Free Time Audrey Hepburn described it best when she said: 'Paris is always a good idea.' We’re sure you’ll agree. Hit its grand boulevards on a city sightseeing tour with your Travel Director. See the Arc de Triomphe and Champs-Élysées then spend the rest of the day discovering the city on your terms. Don’t resist the urge to tread in the footsteps of Picasso and Dalí and visit Montmartre this afternoon, exploring its maze of streets and Artist’s Square. There’s time to shop for artwork and savour some local specialities before considering a real highlight this evening – an optional dinner and cabaret performance. Day 3 - Paris - Lucerne Region Journey through the idyllic French countryside before arriving in Lake Lucerne. You’ll want to put the 'heart' of Switzerland in your pocket and take its history, culture and epic landscapes with you. Day 4 - Lucerne orientation and free time Turn the page to a land of fairy-tale landscapes and medieval history. You have a full day to see the sights and explore Lucerne, starting with a morning orientation including the Chapel Bridge and the Jesuit Church. No visit to Lucerne is complete without a visit to the Lion Monument, built to commemorate the brave Swiss Guards who died defending Louis XVI during the French Revolution. You may be tempted to do some souvenir shopping, but a Choice Experience into the mountains will be hard to resist. Ascend Mount Pilatus by a cog-wheel railway then embark on a scenic lake cruise. Day 5 - Lucerne - Florence (Campi Bisenzio) Your journey heads south to the city of Florence - home to various masterpieces of Renaissance architecture and outstanding fine arts. Enjoy dinner with your fellow travellers tonight as you prepare to soak up the beauty of the city, surrounded by Tuscan countryside, that has remained unchanged throughout the centuries. Day 6 - Florence – Rome Enjoy your day in Florence before heading to Rome. Admire the city skyline from Piazzale Michelangelo. There’s time to explore Piazza della Signoria, the Duomo and Giotto's Bell Tower or shop for the bespoke Italian leather goods and fine gold jewellery for which Florence is justifiably famous. You could choose instead to join a Choice Experience revealing the Renaissance heritage of a city which attracted artists, physicists, astronomers and philosophers like Michelangelo, Machiavelli and Galileo. Next, travel to Rome. If Rome was a person, she would be confident, alluring and complex. You’ll get to know her, and her quirks, over the next two days. You’ll find reminders of an ancient world, a holy empire and the Renaissance around every turn. You could choose to join a Local Guide for an optional guided stroll through Rome’s piazzas. Linger in your favourite square, or perhaps enjoy a scoop or three of the local gelato and soak up the effervescent energy of a city that knows how to enjoy life. Day 7 - Rome Sightseeing and Free Time You could spend a lifetime exploring Rome and just scratch the surface, but with your Local Guide on hand you’ll dive right into the city’s heart and soul. Head to Vatican City to watch the pigeons and people tread on holy ground. The rest of your day is free to explore the City. This evening, why not consider an optional dinner at one of the local restaurants? Day 8 - Rome – Venice (Mestre) Journey on to Venice, which bewitches in all her Byzantine glory, softening even the hardest of hearts with her opulence. Highlights include a cruise on a private launch to St. Mark’s Square and views of the magnificent St. Mark’s Basilica and Doge's Palace. The talents of master craftsmen are the star of the show later as you visit their glassblowing workshop, a MAKE TRAVEL MATTER® Experience. There’s even time for an optional Gondola and Grand Canal cruise – grand palazzi, churches and ornate bridges line your journey. Day 9 - Venice – Innsbruck Today you continue along the Inn Valley to the Austrian Tyrol and its capital, Innsbruck, where you can 'ooh and aah' at the impressive ski jump and view the famed Golden Roof, constructed from 2,657 copper tiles. Admire the fascinating crystal installations and browse for precious gifts and souvenirs at the Swarovski Crystal Worlds Store. This evening, a Choice Experience could see you enjoy a lively evening of entertainment during a traditional Tyrolean evening. Day 10 - Innsbruck - Munich - Rhineland Your first stop today is Munich where you can admire the Glockenspiel in the Marienplatz and the Hofbräuhaus. Continue on to the Rhineland. Day 11 - On to Amsterdam Suitably inspired by its spires, you’ll board a lazy river cruise down the Rhine past terraced vineyards and fairy-tale castles. Your experience of a lifetime ends in the free-thinking capital of the Netherlands. Immerse yourself in Amsterdam's gezelligheid as you soak up the buzz of the city's canals, gabled houses and festive squares. There's no better way to see the capital than from its waterways, why not join a Choice Experience in a glass-topped boat winding through Amsterdam's historic canal ring. Day 12 - Depart Amsterdam Say farewell to your Travel Director and travelling companions at the end of an amazing two-week tour of Europe.
