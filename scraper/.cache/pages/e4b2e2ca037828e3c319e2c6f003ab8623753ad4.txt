Liverpool is also home to the stunningly original Anglican cathedral, considered the biggest in Britain, and of the famous dish known as “scouse,” which you can enjoy in multiple restaurants across the city. Day 2: Isle of Man (Douglas) 27 Jul 26 08:00 AM - 06:00 PM Tucked between Ireland and England lies the little known (and even lesser visited) Isle of Man. Don't be surprised if you have not heard of this little island – with a population of less than 85,000, this stunning maritime jewel nestled within the Irish Sea heaves is fairly far off the beaten track. The Isle of Man's picturesque capital, Douglas, offers visitors a nostalgic link to the past, so enjoy its seamless blend of history, culture, and coastal allure. From its seafront promenade to the historic architecture that graces its streets, Douglas offers a captivating glimpse into the island's character, and no one can be dispointed with the stunningly pretty harbor that pulses with life with fishing boats and yachts comfortably coexisting or the authentic Horse Tramway, where visitors to the island can take a leisurely ride along the coast. As you wander the streets, the presence of the Isle of Man's rich history envelops you. Explore the Manx Museum, where artifacts and exhibits unveil tales of ancient Celts, Vikings, and more. Day 3: Dublin (Dun Loaghaire), Ireland 28 Jul 26 08:00 AM to 06:00 PM Situated in the southern coastal area of Dublin, the town of Dún Laoghaire is a residential area with many things to do and see. You can visit the People's Park Farmers' Market to shop for hand-made crafts and try local delicacies, walk along the charming East Pier or try water sports such as sailing or kayaking. Day 4: Cobh, Ireland 29 Jul 26 08:00 AM to 05:00 PM If you are looking for a captivating city, full of charisma, then look no further than Cobh. Pronounced Cove, this picturesque town on the southern coast of Ireland exudes a rich maritime heritage and a captivating charm that lingers in the hearts of visitors. With its typical houses cascading down the hills, its lovely placement on the mouth of the River Lee, Cobh is a delightful blend of history, culture, and scenic beauty and a very easy destination to spend a few hours. The city is of course best known for its connection to the Titanic, as it has a poignant link to history as the last port of call for the ill-fated ship. The Titanic Experience in the original White Star Line building invites you to step into the past and immerse yourself in the stories of the passengers who embarked on that fateful journey. For those who feel the pull of The Emerald Isle's urban charms, then why not take the short 12-mile trip to Cork, Ireland's second largest city. Here you will find an eclectic, vibrant cultural scene, oodles of living history, plus plenty of traditional pubs showcasing the famous lively Irish atmosphere. Day 5: Fowey, United Kingdom 30 Jul 26 08:00 AM - 07:00 PM Whether you see it from the hills above, the water below or the narrow tangle of streets that wind within, the town of Fowey is simply charming. This quaint Cornish town boasts a 14th century parish church, with a traditional bell tower that peeks out from behind the colorful buildings that gather around it. Situated at the mouth of the river Fowey, this fishing town has a picturesque waterfront and the remains of a small castle sitting above Readymoney Beach. Day 6: St Peter Port, Guernsey 31 Jul 26 07:00 AM - 05:00 PM If you are looking for a unique blend of British and French charm in an idyllic setting, then look no further than St. Peter Port. The Channel Islands' blend of cultural diversity, historical significance, natural beauty, and autonomy make them one of the most coveted archipelagos on travelers' wish lists. The 19 islands (seven of which are inhabited) possess a distinct identity, they have their own governments, legal systems, and even currency and are known for their olde world charm, stunning landscapes with beautiful beaches, lush countryside, and historical sites. St Peter Port, the largest town on the second largest islands Guernsey, sits around 40 miles off the French coast of Normandy – in the Gulf of St Malo – and the influence of past French culture can still be felt on the island. It's like stepping back in time: St. Peter Port's heart lies in its picturesque harbor, where colorful houses cascade down the hillside, creating a postcard-worthy scene and the bustling harbor is dotted with sailboats and fishing vessels, giving it an authentic maritime ambiance. The town boasts a rich history evident in its architecture. St. Peter Port Castle, dating back to the 13th century, and Castle Cornet, a historic fortress, stand as reminders of the island's past. Georgian and Regency buildings lend an air of timeless elegance to the streets. Naturally, there are plenty of pubs serving pints and fish and chips and tea shops serving cream teas – this is still Britan after all! Be sure to enjoy some authentic Channel Islands fare before you leave. Day 7: Le Havre, France 1 Aug 26 07:00 AM - 07:00 PM With a name that literally means, `the Harbor,` Le Havre is indeed a city that grew out of a need for a working port. In the early 16th century, the harbor at Honfleur was silting up, rendering the port less and less usable. King Francois I had a solution: establish another harbor on the right bank of the Seine estuary, just 15 miles from Honfleur. So it came to pass that in 1517, Le Havre was built. Though it always had a military function, Le Havre flourished essentially as a commercial port, receiving cotton, tobacco and sugar from America and distributing the goods throughout France. But its military role was expanded in the 17th century when the harbor was converted to a naval base. In WWII, Le Havre was pressed into even greater military service as it became a stronghold on the continent. The city you see today is mostly post-war construction-much of Le Havre was destroyed during the war. Its reconstruction was overseen by architect Auguste Perret. Its commercial rebirth was spurred by the bustling port activity that began in the 1960s, and continues today. Day 8 to 9: Ijmuiden (Amsterdam), Netherlands 2-3 Aug 26 Arrival: 12:00 PM (Overnight) At just 17 miles from Amsterdam, many visitors to Ijmuiden opt to go straight to the capital. But, while the bright lights of the big city might be the biggest attraction, Ijmuiden provides easy access to many of the country's highlights. The vast beaches of Ijmuiden Strand are just 2 miles away and easily reachable by foot, while Haarlem, the Netherlands' finest example of cafés, canals, cobbled streets and cosy bars is only 30-minutes by train.
