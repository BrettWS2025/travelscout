Begin your journey in Zagreb, the country’s political and cultural capital. You’ll have time to get a feel for its squares, markets and cobbled alleys before meeting your Travel Director and fellow travellers this evening for dinner. Day 2 - Sightseeing in Zagreb Zagreb’s medieval heart is the star of the show today – a charming centre that is both vibrant and historic and you’ll imagine life centuries ago as your Local Specialist reveals some of the landmarks that have lined its cobblestone streets for hundreds of years. Explore the charming upper town which spills on to St. Mark’s Square with its original Romanesque buildings and colourful St. Mark’s Church, renowned for its ornate frescoes. The beauty of Bled isn’t far off and you’ll head through Slovenia’s celebrated green landscapes for this popular lakeside resort town, a highlight on many of our Croatia and Slovenia tours. You’ll learn about the legendary fairies that created the lake to protect their moonlit dancefloor – Bled Island. Learn about the historic characters, such as Holy Roman Emperor Henry II, who frequented the lake for its relaxing vistas and reputed medicinal benefits. Admire the surrounding Alpine landscape which is simply irresistible as you’ll come to discover over the next few days. Day 3 - Explore the beauty of lakeside Bled Connect with Locals The warm, clear turquoise water of Lake Bled is the backdrop for today’s sightseeing and you’ll have a full day to explore its enchanting landscape. There's plenty of time to explore the Lake Bled's picturesque surroundings as you stroll along its tranquil shores. The crystal-clear waters reflect the stunning Bled Castle perched atop a rocky cliff, while the traditional pletna boats glide gracefully towards the enchanting Bled Island. Lush greenery, quaint lakeside cafes, and the distant Julian Alps complete the idyllic scene, inviting you to savour every moment of this Slovenian paradise.This evening's exclusive Be My Guest experience is one you’ll be talking about for years to come: you’ll visit the Slibar farm, discovering how it has been run by the family for six generations. Enjoy homegrown Slovenian hospitality and all the local favourites served on sharing plates, including seasonal vegetables. Day 4 - Onwards to Ljubljana and Opatija Leaving Bled behind, you’ll travel to one of Europe’s smallest capitals – the ‘Hero City’, Ljubljana. Discover its mythical dragon heritage as you explore the highlights on foot, enjoying the charm of this car-free university town. Walk through the Old Town with its two medieval squares, connected by narrow lanes, and stand in Prešeren Square, named after Slovenia’s greatest poet. From below, you’ll spot Ljubljana Castle keeping watch over the city, just as it has for more than nine centuries. The extraordinary Triple Bridge links the medieval heart of the city with its modern side. Later, stop in Postojna to visit the caves before crossing into Croatia’s riviera, where you’ll slow down and settle into the coastal town of Opatija. Day 5 - Enjoy a Day in Pula and Rovinj Start your day in the coastal city of Pula on Croatia’s Istrian Peninsula where your visit to the 1st-century Pula Arena with a Local Specialist will reveal the city's role as a strategic location for the Romans, Ostrogoths, Venetians and finally, many years later, the Allied Forces in World War II. A true travel highlight, this ancient amphitheatre, the sixth-largest and one of the best-preserved in the world, was built at the same time the Colosseum was constructed. Next, travel to the fishing port of Rovinj and wander through the Old Town, contemplating its Mediterranean influences and island walls. Returning to Opatija later, you’ll have time for a quiet walk along the town’s Lungomare; perhaps spending a few soul-stirring moments paying tribute to the statuesque nymph cradling a seagull in her outstretched hands. Day 6 - Off to Stunning Plitvice Make Travel Matter Few experiences will match today’s guided walking tour of the UNESCO-listed Plitviče, one of the oldest and largest national parks in Croatia. On this MAKE TRAVEL MATTER® Experience, you’ll choose one of two walks revealing the cascading lake waters shifting from azure to green, grey to blue depending on how the sun hits the water. Admire sweeping views of the canyon during your short walk and, if you’re feeling a little more energetic, there’s always an opportunity to lace up for the long walk where you’ll join your Local Specialist and head into the canyon to Kozjek Lake. You’ll discover how these beautiful lakes, caves and waterfalls have been shaped over thousands of years and remain pristine for generations to come thanks to visits like yours to the area. Day 7 - Admire Historic Trogir and on to Split Dive Into Culture Join your Local Specialist and go beyond the fortress walls of Trogir to explore its charming medieval heart connected to the mainland and island of Čiovo by bridges. Learn about its rich history which spans the Hellenistic period to a time when Venice was the ruler of the Adriatic as you admire the island’s ornate Renaissance and Baroque buildings. You’ll visit Diocletian’s Palace around which the city of Split was built and Dive Into Culture hearing about the legacy of the Roman Empire and how Emperor Diocletian settled on this stunning landscape for his retirement, building a palace fit for an emperor. Your Local Specialist will share the remnants of luxurious squares and temples that still stand many centuries later. There’s no visiting Split without enjoying a seafood dinner and you’ll have plenty of time over the next two days to discover the city by night along with its Dalmatian flavours. Day 8 - Split Your Way Discover why Split has justifiably earned its nickname “the most beautiful city in the world” with a full day to explore its heart and beyond. People-watch in Pjaca Square where citizens of Split have met for centuries, then ascend the bell tower for magnificent views of the sprawling terracotta roofs and white marble façades that seem to tumble into the Adriatic. Having worked up an appetite, you’ll be spoilt for choice with the many cafes tucked away in hidden lanes – find one to enjoy a leisurely local lunch surrounded by Split’s rich history. You could choose instead a full-day Optional Experience to one of the Dalmatian Islands which will leave you with a deep appreciation for what it’s like to live in an area that is as beautiful as its history was tumultuous. Day 9 - On to the 'Pearl of the Adriatic' The impressive walls of Dubrovnik beckon. It’s easy to see why poets, painters and playwrights were drawn to this walled city. Explore its cobbled staircases and backstreets, and uncover the layers of its past. Once a powerful city-state that rivalled Venice, Dubrovnik stood strong behind its fortified walls, resisting even the Ottomans. This morning, join your Local Specialist to see the Rector’s Palace, Onofrio’s Fountain and the city’s monastic landmarks. In the afternoon, you may choose an Optional Experience to a nearby village to see how olive oil is pressed the traditional way, followed by a home-cooked lunch. Another Optional Experience invites you on a sunset cruise along the Adriatic, with dinner served on board. Day 10 - Free Time to Explore Dubrovnik Today is yours to enjoy more of Dubrovnik before your Croatia and Slovenia tour comes to an end. You could join an Optional Experience to Cavtat, strolling the old town with your Local Specialist, before you visit a winery in the Konavle Valley for wine with pršut and cheese. This evening, gather for dinner, toasting to the Adriatic and the memories you’ve made. Day 11 - Farewell Dubrovnik Our time together comes to an end this morning after breakfast.
