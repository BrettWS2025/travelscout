Please check price at time of booking Itinerary Day 1: Santa Cruz Upon arrival at Seymour Airport on Baltra Island, you will be welcomed and transferred to the Galapagos Explorer. Cruise to Black Turtle Cove, a mangrove estuary featuring black, red and brown mangroves. Pristine and naturally secluded, the cove is a haven for rare fauna and flora and has been declared a turtle sanctuary. Zodiac craft are required to turn off their motors while visiting, allowing you to truly become immersed in the sights and sounds of your natural surrounds. Day 2: Santiago & Rabida This morning explore Santiago Island which features a gently sloping volcanic cone that emerges from the ocean, resembling the distinctive shape of an old-fashioned Chinese hat. In the west you can see lava formations topped with coral heads, which are an indicator that the flows were once formed under the sea. Look out for bright red Sally Lightfoot crabs, marine iguanas, lava lizards and sea lions. This is also an excellent snorkelling site. This afternoon we visit Rabida Island. Celebrated as one of the most colourful and volcanically varied islands in the archipelago, Rabida’s famous red sandy beach (the only one in the Galapagos) and stunning lookouts provide unmatched photographic opportunities. The island is also a birdwatcher’s delight where some of the region’s rarest species are in abundance. Day 3: Santiago This morning take a walk along the coastline at James Bay in search of American oystercatchers, lava herons, great blue herons as well as bright red Sally Lightfoot crabs. Towards the end of the walk, you’ll find a beautiful, eroded lava tunnel offering one of the only chances to see the Galapagos fur seal. In the afternoon enjoy the Espumilla Beach area with its secluded coves and pristine white sandy beaches, ideal for leisurely walks, swimming, and kayaking. Later, Buccaneer Cove was named after the first navigators that used the island as an anchorage place to beach their boats while searching for food or water, today, the cove is home to a variety of marine birds, sea lions and fur seals. Only accessible by Zodiac, look out for pelicans, herons, swallow-tailed gulls, and boobies. Day 4: Fernandina Spend the morning at Espinosa Point on Fernandina, one of the most untouched islands in the Galapagos. No foreign species have ever invaded Fernandina and the unique landscape was created by lava fields of the volcano La Cumbre. Marine iguanas conglomerate in larger groups than on any other island and this is one of the best chances to see them dive underwater. In the afternoon at Tagus Cove hike to the top of the cliff to see Darwin Lake, an uplifted ultra-saline lake saltier than the sea. Created from the remains of a tuff cone, Tagus Cove is a secluded bay with calm waters ideal for Zodiac rides, kayaking and snorkelling, providing close encounters with the Galapagos penguin and other iconic sea birds, like the flightless cormorant, Galapagos martin, brown noddy, brown pelican and blue-footed booby. Day 5: Isabela Few have the privilege of exploring secluded Elizabeth Bay, teeming with abundant marine life. Cruise by Zodiac into the sheltered mangrove lagoon, where the tallest red mangroves in the Galapagos tower overhead and graceful sea turtles swim to the water’s surface. Later discover Moreno Point with its coastal lagoons in the middle of black lava flows where several unique bird species can be found. Walk in the lava flows of Sierra Negra and Cerro Azul, some of the Galapagos’ most active volcanoes, and between the island’s three cacti species (lava, candelabra, and prickly pear). Day 6: Santa Cruz Begin your day at El Chato Ranch Private Reserve, where you’ll be able to see the Galapagos giant tortoise. Next, stroll through the Highland’s lush forests, where numerous finch varieties can be spotted. If there’s enough time, you’ll also explore ‘Los Gemelos’, two collapsed calderas surrounded by a distinctive Scalesia forest. In the afternoon visit Charles Darwin Research Station to see conservation in action at the breeding site for giant tortoises. After this, use your free time to explore the town, experiencing the local culture first-hand. Alternatively, this is also the perfect opportunity relax on board the Galapagos Explorer. Day 7: Santa Fe & South Plaza A short walking trail on Santa Fe Island leads you to a large colony of sea lion, afterwards taking you inland to spot the island’s endemic land iguana and large prickly pear cactus forest. With some luck, you may even see the rice rat unique to the islands. This afternoon on South Plaza discover a distinctive landscape of steep cliffs filled with red Sesuvium plants and Opuntia cacti which makes for some of the most interesting wildlife observations available in Galapagos. Land iguanas are easily seen from the walking trail under the shade of cactuses waiting for a prickly pear to fall. Day 8: Mosquera A small island with white sandy beaches, black lava rocks and turquoise waters, Mosquera Island is the last stop of your Galapagos adventure. Highlights include the island’s vibrant colony of Galapagos sea lion, one of the archipelago’s largest, and the nesting grounds of the lava gull, the rarest gull species on the planet. Other creatures to look out for include Sally Lightfoot crabs, marine iguanas and pelicans. Thereafter, it is time to wave a fond farewell to the Galapagos Explorer as you head to Seymour Airport on Baltra Island for your flight onward.
