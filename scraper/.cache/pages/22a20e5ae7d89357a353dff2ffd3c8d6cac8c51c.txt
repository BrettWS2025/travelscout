After you’ve indulged, check out the great view of Paris from the gorgeous Sacre Coeur church, then head to the Marais district to check out the famous Paris flea markets, or wander the Grand Boulevards which give a wonderful insight into historic Paris.

Your first stop is in a traditional, historic cellar, where your expert guide introduces the red and white wines of the region, including Premiers Crus. Afterwards, head to a family-owned vineyard to sample the famous Pinot Noirs over the region and stop in the village of Gevrey-Chambertin on your way back to Dijon. Want to immerse yourself further? Ask your Rail Expert about upgrading to a full-day tour!

Lyon is known as the gastronomic capital of France, and for good reason, with its abundant markets and the authentic and traditional dishes available throughout the city. Explore the Vieux Lyon and Bellecour districts on your own, sampling the iconic cuisine and local delicacies. (Overnight in Lyon) Day 6: Lyon to Avignon Check out of your hotel this morning and board a short train ride over to the Provence region, where you’ll spend two nights in Avignon. After checking in at your hotel for a two-night stay, use your fast-track tickets to explore the famous Palais de Popes, a gigantic gothic palace that nine popes have called home. Continue to the Pont d ’Avignon bridge and enjoy stunning views of the Rhone River. (Overnight in Avignon) Day 7: Cooking Class and Private Wine Tour in Provence This morning, meet your English-speaking chef in front of the famous Les Halles covered market, where you’ll select all the fresh ingredients needed for your lesson. After a short demonstration, try your hands at the classic techniques, and enjoy the fruits of your labour with your handmade Provencal lunch. The tour continues with a private winery tour with a local guide, visiting two cellars and sampling in each. Return to your hotel in the evening, full of a day immersing yourself in the region’s cuisine. (Overnight in Avignon) Day 8: Avignon to Bordeaux After breakfast, head to the train station for your journey to Bordeaux. Once you’ve settled in at your hotel, head to the impressive Cite du Vin complex today to discover everything you didn’t know and thought you knew about the world of wine with your included admission. This vast museum and exhibition centre, housed in a wonderfully futuristic building, holds the world’s biggest selection of wine and tells the global story of wine in a uniquely immersive and sensorial way. Visitors can not only taste but also make wine, as well as enjoy spectacular views across the Garonne River and Bordeaux. (Overnight in Bordeaux) Day 9: Saint Emilion Day Trip from Bordeaux Depart for Saint Emilion with your guide this morning, setting off on a day of wine tasting and exploring multiple wineries. You’ve sampled the Pinot Noirs in Burgundy, and now it’s time to delight your palate with the Chateau Wineries and Merlot red wines. You’ll also have free time to explore the quaint village and do a bit of shopping as well. (Overnight in Bordeaux) Day 10: Bordeaux to Paris Return to Paris today for your final night in France. Cross any remaining sights off your bucket list, and come the evening, board a river cruise along the Seine. While you’re delighted with a delicious 3-course dinner, admire the way the City of Light illuminates as night falls and watch the Eiffel Tower sparkle.
