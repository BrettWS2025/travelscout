Tonight, gather for a welcome dinner. Meals - Breakfast, Lunch & Dinner Day 4: Luxor - Temples of Luxor & Karnak Fly to Luxor, site of the ancient city of Thebes, and visit the striking Temple of Luxor, with its towering statues of Ramses II and the Colonnade of Amenhotep III. Board Sun Boat IV — the elegant Nile riverboat that is your home for the next four nights; then head to Karnak, a spectacular complex of temples built by generation after generation of pharaohs, its courtyards and soaring pillars carved with symbols and gods painted gold in the afternoon sun. Meals - Breakfast, Lunch & Dinner Day 5: Cruising the Nile - Valleys of the Kings and Queens On the West Bank of the Nile River lies quite possibly the world’s most incredible open-air museum: the Necropolis of Thebes. Here lie the Valley of the Kings and the Valley of the Queens, the grandest resting places of the rulers of Ancient Egypt. See the mysterious “singing” Colossi of Memnon and the stunning Temple of Hatshepsut. Delve inside Queen Nefertari’s colourfully painted tomb; the storied chamber of Tutankhamun, revealed to the world in 1922 by British archaeologist Howard Carter; and the beautifully preserved and decorated tomb of Seti I.

Back on your river ship, learn to prepare local dishes during a cooking lesson with your onboard chef. Later this afternoon, sip a cocktail on deck as you cruise to Kom Ombo, the Greco-Roman temple dedicated to Haroeris (the sun god) and Sobek (the crocodile god). Disembark to explore this twin temple and view the mummified remains of several crocodiles that once basked on the banks, just as their descendants do today. Meals - Breakfast, Lunch & Dinner Day 7: Aswan - Sailing Around the Aswan Islands In Aswan, see the ancient granite quarries and site of the Unfinished Obelisk, a partially excavated monolith taller than any other ancient Egyptian obelisk. Board a motorized boat to picturesque Philae Temple on the island of Agilika. A sacred complex dedicated to the goddess Isis, it reflects a fusion of Egyptian, Greek and Roman civilizations. Later, sail around the Aswan Islands in a felucca (traditional sailboat).
