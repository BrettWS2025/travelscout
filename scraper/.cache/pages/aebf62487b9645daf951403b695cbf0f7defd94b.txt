From cities to mountains, this trip promises unforgettable encounters at every turn. Itinerary Day 1: Baku Salam! Welcome to Azerbaijan. Your adventure begins in Baku, with a welcome meeting at 6 pm this evening. If you arrive early, maybe walk around Baku Boulevard, a promenade that stretches along the Caspian Sea – the world’s largest inland body of water. After the meeting, join your leader for a night walk around Azerbaijan’s capital, where they’ll highlight the best spots for dinner. Maybe get your group together for some traditional Azerbaijani dishes, like plov (seasoned rice) or dolma (stuffed vegetables). Day 2: Qobustan/ Baku This morning, drive to Qobustan – also known as Gobustan National Park – a UNESCO World Heritage site that’s famous for its ancient rock carvings and mud volcanoes. Stop on the way to check out these geological formations as they spew mud and gas. Azerbaijan has more clay craters than anywhere else in the world, so you’re in the right place for spotting them! The rock carvings in Qobustan date back to the Stone Age, giving humans today an insight into daily life all those years ago. With over 6000 petroglyphs on display, Qobustan is often referred to as one of the largest open-air museums in the world. Return to Baku in the afternoon and visit the walled Old Town with your leader, who’ll bring its legends and history to life. Enjoy a free evening to explore the city at your own pace. Maybe eat at a restaurant on Nizami Street – a busy boulevard with lots of authentic Azerbaijani cuisine. Day 3: Caucasus Mountains / Lahij Leave Baku this morning and enjoy the change of scenery as the dry landscape giving way to the densely forested mountains along the way. Stop en route in Shamakhi and check out one of the oldest moquests of Azerbaijan - Juma (Friday) Mosque, then onto your final destination for today - the stunning traditional village of Lahij for Tats people. Explore its cobbled streets, stone houses, visit a copper workshop and get to know some local folk over a cup of tea.Then try your hand at yogurt making in the traditional way, an important part of Azerbaijan cuisine. Your accommodation tonight is at a local guesthouse. Day 4: Sheki After breakfast, head to Nij village, a settlement of the Udi people who are the direct descendants of ancient Caucasian Albanians. Most the world’s surviving Udi people call Nij home, giving the community a unique culture. Visit the unassuming site of a significant church and a local museum of Udi Culture. The Albanian Church (as it’s known colloquially) is a source of pride and heritage for the local Udi community. Continue to Sheki afterwards and enjoy a free evening. Day 5: Sheki Visit the Palace of Sheki Khans first in the morning. The walls of the palace are painted with scenes of hunting and war and it features impressive stained glass. Afterwards check out a workshop where shebeke – stained glass windows made with no glue or nails – are produced by local masters witih skills past down through generations of practices. Then get on a local public bus to Kish to visit the pointed spires of a church that is among the oldest in Christendom, believed to be around 1700 years old. Try Azerbaijan’s national dish – Piti for lunch – a stew made of lamb, sheep fat, chickpeas, onions, chestnuts, saffron and spices, and is guaranteed to be full of exciting flavors. The rest of the afternoon is free for you to discover Sheki. Why not explore the impressive traditional architecture on foot. Maybe stop for tea and some local halva (made with sugar, hazelnuts, coriander and rice flour grinned in a watermill). Day 6: Telavi After breakfast, take a walk with your leader through the Sheki market. It’s a great opportunity to stock up on snacks for the journey ahead, so maybe grab some halva, nuts and dried fruit. Continue to Lagodekhi on the Azerbaijan-Georgia border. Travel through the beautiful green valleys of the Kakheti region to Gremi – a complex that includes a castle and church from the 16th century. Spend some time here before hitting the road again, stopping at a traditional Georgian wine producer that still employs the ancient, UNESCO-listed qvevri method. Enjoy lunch here and then finish your journey in Telavi, where you’ll stay in a local hotel for the evening. Day 7: Gudauri In the morning, wander through the vibrant local farmers market in Telavi, where butchers carve up fresh meat and vendors offload piles of spices, then visit Tsinandalia, a historic estate and winery once owned by noted Georgian poet Alexander Chavchavadze. In 1814, aristocrat Chavchavadze was the first to bottle wine produced using the qvevri method. Tour the complex, which consists of a memorial house, European-style landscaped garden, a traditional winery, wine cellar, hotel and cafe. Continue to UNESCO listed Alaverdi Cathedral that dates back to 6th century. Afterwards, drive into the mountains up the renowned Georgian Military Highway. Enjoy a dinner together and spend the night in lofty Gudauri. Day 8: Gudauri / Stepantsminda Follow the Tergi River on a drive to Stepantsminda, formerly known as Kazbegi. Explore this mountain village then hike through beautiful valleys and woodlands to the iconic Gergeti Trinity Church. This 14th-century church sits at the base of the second-highest volcanic summit in the Caucasus – Mt Kazbegi – and, weather permitting, you may catch a glimpse. The image of the pointed spires of the isolated church against the mountains is truly breathtaking, and a great place for a photo. Drive back to Gudauri for a dinner with your group. Day 9: Tbilisi Make the drive to Tbilisi, the capital of Georgia, located along the banks of the Kura River. Get into the swing of things with an orientation walk with your leader. Spend the rest of the day as you wish, perhaps grabbing a khachapuri (bread stuffed with salty cheese) to snack on. In the evening, regroup and head out for dinner with your fellow travellers and leader. This is a good chance to sample some khinkali (Georgia’s famous soup-filled dumplings). Make sure to ask your leader about the polite way to eat them – it involves sipping the broth and leaving the pinched bit of dough where the edges of the delicious parcel have joined on the plate. Day 10: Tbilisi Your trip comes to an end today after breakfast. If you'd like to extend your stay, just get in touch with your booking agent ahead of time.
