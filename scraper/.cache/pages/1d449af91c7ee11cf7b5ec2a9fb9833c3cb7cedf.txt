Danny Leonie Paul House of Travel Merivale With nearly two decades at House of Travel, I’m always dreaming of the next adventure. The more I explore, the longer my bucket list grows! The thrill of planning a new journey and learning from each experience excites me. Discussing travel daily is my passion, I love helping clients realize their travel dreams and living vicariously through their experiences. Getting to know my clients and understanding what matters most to them is something I truly enjoy. This insight allows me to craft itineraries that are as unique and special as the travelers themselves. There's nothing more satisfying than a client returning with tales of their adventures.

With every journey, I find new perspectives, cultures, and places to love. Travel isn’t just about the places we visit—it's about the growth we experience along the way.
