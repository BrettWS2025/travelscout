You’re arriving in a city that’s always on the move, but first, settle in and take some time to explore before meeting your fellow travellers and Travel Director for dinner — your first taste of South Korea’s flavour-packed dishes. Day 2 - Explore Cultural Seoul Your first full day in Seoul begins at Gwanghwamun Gate, watching the Changing of the Guard Ceremony before stepping into the grand Gyeongbokgung Palace, the largest of the city’s five palaces. Follow your taste buds to Insadong Street, where you can grab lunch of your choice. Lined with traditional tea houses, art galleries and craft shops, it’s also a great spot to pick up unique souvenirs. But don’t fill up just yet because this afternoon takes you on a food tour through Gwangjang Market, tasting dishes like crispy nokdujeon, spicy tteok-bokki and Korea’s iconic kimchi. Day 3 - Into Korea’s Demilitarised Zone Get ready for a fascinating day at the Korean Demilitarised Zone. Travelling by military shuttle with a Local Specialist, you’ll dive into the history of one of the world’s most heavily guarded border. Head deep underground into the Third Infiltration Tunnel, a secret passage built for invasion, before making your way to the Dora Observatory for a rare view across to North Korea (weather permitting) — spot the country’s peace village in the distance. After a visit to the Unification Village, where daily life carries on in the shadow of history, enjoy lunch at a local restaurant. For those interested to learn more about the Korean War, join an Optional Experience to the War Memorial of Korea, where exhibitions explore the country’s military history and its lasting impact. Day 4 - Buddhist Heritage in Andong Speed through the countryside on Korea’s high-speed train, arriving in Andong, the cultural heart of Korea. Here, step into the tranquillity of Bongjeonsa Temple, home to the nation’s oldest wooden building and centuries of Buddhist heritage. The journey continues at Dosan Seowon Confucian Academy, where scholar Toegye Yi Hwang once taught, shaping Korea’s intellectual traditions. Cross Woryeonggyo Bridge, the longest wooden bridge in the country, its design inspired by a tragic legend. As evening falls, get ready for a heartwarming Be My Guest experience at your host Jongbu Kim Do-Eun’s home, where Joseon-era recipes are lovingly brought to life over a shared meal. Day 5 - Explore Historic Andong Your day kicks off in Hahoe Village, a UNESCO-listed gem where Joseon-era architecture, Confucian traditions and folk heritage thrive. You’ll wander through the historic streets before a leisurely stroll to Buyongdae Cliff for panoramic views of the village’s lotus-like layout. At the Hahoe World Mask Museum, you’ll see intricate masks that bring Korea’s traditional dances to life. After a local lunch, Dive into Culture at the Hahoe Mask Dance Show, where satire, storytelling and rhythmic movement take centre stage. Meet the performers, try a few moves then head to Gyeongju for your Stays with Stories experience at Lahan Select Hotel. You’ll love this award-winning hotel, designed by Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction, it features a striking S-shaped facade, blending modern innovation with comfort in the heart of the city. Day 6 - Discover Ancient Korea in Gyeongju Step into Ancient Korea in Gyeongju, where you’ll uncover the legends and history of the Silla dynasty. Start at the UNESCO-listed Bulguksa Temple, a masterpiece of Buddhist culture, before visiting the Seokguram Grotto, home to an ancient granite Buddha and breathtaking carvings. Wander through the royal tombs of Daereungwon, where Silla kings and queens rest beneath towering earth mounds. Later, admire Woljeonggyo Bridge, an iconic Silla-era structure restored to its former glory. Then, explore the serene gardens of Donggung Palace and Wolji Pond, once part of a grand palace complex. Day 7 - Onwards to Busan Today, it’s goodbye Gyeongju and hello to Busan, South Korea’s vibrant coastal city. Start with a ride on the Skyline Park Sky Capsule, a colourful elevated railway offering sweeping sea views. Next, visit Haedong Yonggungsa Temple, a rare seaside Buddhist temple, where the 108 stone steps lead to pagodas set against the crashing waves. In the afternoon, pause for reflection at the United Nations Memorial Cemetery, the only UN cemetery in the world, honouring casualties of the Korean War from 11 nations. End the day on Dongbaekseom Island, the Island of Camellias, where you’ll walk along coastal trails and enjoy panoramic views of Busan’s skyline. For a view of Busan after dark, join an Optional Experience night cruise from Haeundae. See the coastline lit up, with Gwangan Bridge and the city skyline against the night sky. Day 8 - Sea Views, Rice Wine and Markets in Busan Gamcheon Cultural Village is up first today, a hillside gem packed with colourful houses, murals and quirky cafes that make every turn an adventure. Ride the Songdo Sea Cable Car, floating 86m above the ocean with epic views over Songdo Beach and the coastline. Dive into the buzz of Gukje Market, where you can grab lunch from sizzling street stalls or hunt for souvenirs in the maze of shops. Wrap up with a MAKE TRAVEL MATTER® Experience, meeting Yoo Cheong-gil, South Korea’s only officially recognised makgeolli (rice wine) master. Over a rice wine tasting, you’ll hear firsthand about the challenges of keeping this tradition alive in a rapidly changing world. Day 9 - High Speed Return to Seoul Checking out of Busan, board your final high-speed train back to Seoul, racing through the countryside in comfort. The afternoon is yours to explore more of the city, do some last-minute shopping, or simply soak up South Korea’s capital one last time. You can also make the most of your free time with a choice of two Optional Experiences. Join a walking tour through Hongdae, one of Seoul’s most creative neighbourhoods, known for its street art, indie shops and youth culture. Or step into the world of K-pop with a dance class led by a local instructor, where you’ll learn the moves behind Korea’s biggest hits. Ending on a high, join your Travel Director and fellow travellers for a Korean barbecue dinner, celebrating an unforgettable journey. Day 10 - Farewell Seoul It’s time to say goodbye to Seoul and head home, but not without a suitcase full of souvenirs, unforgettable memories and new friends.
