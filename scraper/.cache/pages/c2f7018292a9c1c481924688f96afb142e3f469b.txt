Choose from one of our four favourites and soak in the local Anangu culture and enjoy a genuine Indigenous experience. In this deal we feature Outback Hotel but ask us for a quote if you would like a different choice. Outback Hotel, Ayers Rock Resort, l aid-back accommodation meets warm Australian hospitality at the Outback Hotel. With air-conditioned rooms featuring private ensuite bathrooms, tea and coffee making facilities, and a number of configurations perfect for families or friends travelling together, the Outback Hotel is the perfect mix of comfort and value. Enjoy access to all Resort facilities, including a FREE Indigenous Activities Program, return Ayers Rock Airport transfers, and a free resort shuttle bus that will help you get around. The Lost Camel Hotel, Ayers Rock Resort is a contemporary and fun, boutique-style hotel conveniently located in the heart of Ayers Rock Resort, only 20 minutes from Uluru. Furnished in a stylish mix of Aboriginal and urban themes, The Lost Camel adds a unique and surprisingly edgy accommodation option to the collection of hotels at the Resort. Desert Gardens Hotel, Ayers Rock Resort Imagine waking up to a sunrise view of Uluru, blazing red under a sunny Outback sky. Desert Gardens Hotel boasts the only rooms with views of Uluru in Ayers Rock Resort. Perched within an oasis of native gardens, and providing a relaxing retreat from a day of adventure. Sails in the Desert, Ayers Rock Resort Indulgent escapes await at Sails in the Desert, where soaring white sails shade your lavishly appointed room. Cool off in the sparkling swimming pool lined with lush gumtrees or linger over unique Australian flavours paired perfectly with your favourite regional wines at one of the resort's dining, lounge, and bar options. Relax in the brasserie-style Ilkari Restaurant, unwind after a day of exploring with cocktails and Indigenous-inspired cuisine in the Walpa Lobby Bar, or curl up on one of the daybeds and enjoy a casual lunch and beverage by the pool. A must do is the Field of Light where as far as the eye can see gentle rhythms of colour light up the desert. The exhibition, aptly named Tili Wiru Tjuta Nyakunytjaku or ‘looking at lots of beautiful lights’ in local Pitjantjatjara is internationally celebrated artist Bruce Munro’s largest work to date. Overwhelming in size, covering more than seven football fields, it invites immersion in its fantasy garden of 50,000 spindles of light, the stems breathing and swaying through a sympathetic desert spectrum of ochre, deep violet, blue and gentle white. Afternoon Uluru Sunset Tour departing the resort, travel through the landscapes to the entrance of the Uluru Kata Tjuta National Park. From this point, it is only a matter of minutes before the spectra of Uluru rises from the sand dunes to demonstrate its enormity and presence in this country. Our first step allows you a photographic opportunity of this amazing icon. With Uluru looming in front of you, you journey toward the base. Walk with your guide to a place of tranquility.
