Day 10 Vancouver (Embarkation) Alaskan Adventure by Sea. Wave goodbye to your Tour Director and Driver in Vancouver before embarking on your 7-night Alaska Inside Passage cruise. Day 11 Cruising: Inside Passage, Alaska Glacial Fjords & Grand Forests. Alaska’s Inside Passage is a protected network of waterways that wind through glacier-cut fjords and lush temperate rain forests along the rugged coast of Southeast Alaska. Arguably one of the greatest cruising routes in the world, the Inside Passage stretches through stunning landscapes, from Misty Fjords National Monument to famed Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve. Day 12 Cruising: Tracy Arm - Juneau, Alaska Coastal Cliffs & The Catch of the Day. Steep cliffs and glacier-covered mountains flank the Tracy Arm fjord, fringed by the largest intact coastal temperate rainforest in the United States. Old-growth trees colonised Tracy Arm's mouth long ago as the Ice Age retreated. Continue cruising to Juneau, Alaska and visit the most remote state capital in the United States. Surrounded by water, forest and mountain sights, visitors in Juneau can hike a glacier, eat fresh-caught fish on a seaside patio and tour a grand capitol building all in one day. Day 13 Skagway The Rush for Gold. At the height of the Klondike Gold Rush, the port town of Skagway served as the primary gateway to the legendary gold fields, and quickly grew into Alaska’s largest settlement. It was then a raucous frontier hub packed with trading posts, saloons, and guesthouses. As the gold rush faded into the 1900s, so did Skagway—but today it has been reinvigorated as a gateway for a new kind of visitor: those looking to explore Alaska’s colourful history, pristine wildlife, and unrivaled natural beauty. Day 14 Cruising: Glacier Bay National Park On your cruise to Glacier Bay (a UNESCO World Heritage Site), close your eyes and take in the sounds—the creaks and groans of “living” ice, the shrill cries of gulls and soaring eagles, the splash of a breaching humpback whale. Frosted peaks towering over mossy forests, wide tidewater glaciers (there are seven in the park), and frequent wildlife sightings on Glacier Bay cruises are just a few of the thrilling experiences in this unique and beautiful biosphere.
