Why not arrive early and head to the Seattle Aquarium to see sea otters and a giant Pacific octopus. Or for incredible views of Puget Sound and the surrounding mountains, take a stroll through the nine-acre Olympic Sculpture Park, admiring the work of renowned artists as you go. And for a feast of the senses, visit the famous Pike Place Market. Operating for over a century, this lively farmer’s market boasts everything from buskers and bars to salmon-throwing fishmongers! You’ll spend the night here in Seattle before your connecting flight to Alaska tomorrow. If you have the time to go farther afield, we recommend booking a Pre-Programme with us and discovering some of the region’s natural highlights. Day 2: There's no place like Nome Setting off on your adventure Today you’ll take an early flight from Seattle to Nome, Alaska, where your state-of-the art expedition ship awaits to take you on a journey through the famed Northwest Passage and beyond. Prospectors first came to Nome in 1898, and people still hunt for gold here today. You'll see evidence of the Gold Rush era all around, including abandoned dredges, turn-of-the century steam engines and old railroad tracks, lending the town a unique and intriguing atmosphere. You’ll be in good company as you explore the town. Wyatt Earp, the famous sheriff, opened a saloon here. Nome was also the end point of three of Roald Amundsen's great polar expeditions. Upon boarding the ship and after collecting your complimentary expedition jacket, it's time to check out your cabin, meet the Expedition Team and explore your new home-from-home. Your adventure has truly begun! Day 3-6: Along the Alaskan coast Science and wildlife watching at sea Join your Expedition Team for insightful lectures as we journey through the Beaufort Sea towards Amundsen Gulf, the gates to the Northwest Passage on this eastbound transit. Topics might include subjects such as wildlife, tectonic activity, glaciology and local history which will prepare you for the adventures ahead. The highlights of this transit include: The Bering Strait International Date Line Sailing Across the Beaufort Sea Wildlife Watching Day 7-14: Exploration and adventure Spend eight days exploring the Western section of the fabled Northwest Passage Our excursions begin on day seven as we enter the Western Canadian Arctic. Over the next eight days in this section of our voyage we’ll transit through three distinct regions - Nunavut, Northwest Territories, and Yukon – and two traditional Inuit Territories – Inuvialuit and Nunavut. During our time here, we anticipate up to five days of shore excursions and four transit days. Excursion stops and local highlights we hope to be able to visit include: Herschel Island Smoking Hills Ulukhaktok Coronation Gulf Cambridge Bay (Iqaluktuuttiaq) Gjoa Haven (Uqsuqtuuk) Day 15: Into Bellot Strait Navigate the dividing line between West and East The ‘Rubicon’ of the Canadian Arctic that divides West from East is the infamous Bellot Strait. This narrow body of water separates the northernmost part of mainland North America from Somerset Island, one of the largest islands in the Canadian Arctic archipelago. Bellot Strait is approximately 15 nautical miles long and just over half a mile wide at its narrowest point. Our ability to navigate this passage will be determined by ice and weather conditions. Day 16-20: The Eastern Canadian Arctic Explore the Eastern stretch of the Passage On the eastern shores of Somerset Island, we find ourselves in the Eastern Canadian Arctic. The main waterway of this area is Lancaster Sound (Tallurutiup Imanga), the eastern gates to the Northwest Passage. This chapter of our exploration is likely to be action-packed, with excursions planned on each of the five days we hope to spend in and around this area. Remember, all our excursion plans are weather and ice dependent but, conditions permitting, our days will be filled with excitement and discovery. Excursion stops and local highlights we hope to share with you include: Fort Ross Prince Leopold Island (Appait) Beechey Island (Iluvilik) Croker Bay Dundas Harbour Pond Inlet (Mittimatalik) Day 21: Crossing Baffin Bay Watch for wildlife and get involved in Citizen Science Leaving Nunavut behind, our expedition cruise continues to Greenland across Baffin Bay. The Expedition Team will continue their onboard lectures on topics such as the wildlife of the Arctic, Inuit culture and the history of exploration in this region. Why not take part in one of our Citizen Science projects, helping photograph and track whales, or observing the clouds to help scientists study our climate by contributing to the GLOBE Program. Day 22-24: The Wonders of West Greenland Discover the magical beauty of Greenland The final chapter of our journey encompasses the majestic coast of West Greenland. We will begin by sailing into Disko Bay – a haven for whales and seals. Over the next three days you’ll experience some of the most iconic sites in all of Greenland. Our objectives include: Ilulissat Nestled at the edge of the magnificent Ilulissat Icefjord, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is Ilulissat. Here you’ll find an ever-changing gallery of passing icebergs set against a backdrop of colourful houses. In town you can visit a multitude of shops selling local crafts, and on the outskirts walking trails take you along the epic icefjord. Sisimiut Sisimiut is Greenland’s second city, situated in a spectacular location just above the Arctic Circle. This area has history spanning more than 4,500 years, and old traditions are alive and well. Learn more about ancient Saqqaq artifacts in the local museum or stretch your legs on a hike. If you're looking for a special souvenir, pick up a scarf, hat or mittens made of qiviut , the inner wool of the musk ox that’s said to be 10 times warmer than sheep’s wool. Evighedsfjord As we head north, we plan to offer an exploration day in the magical and pristine Evighedsfjord near Maniitsoq. We'll determine on the day what adventures we can take part in. The 'Fjord of Eternity' is fed by an ice cap that calves huge icebergs into its 2,300 ft deep waters. It's surrounded by mist-cloaked mountains with beautiful white ridges, punctuated by crystal blue ice caves. Day 25: Old and new in Nuuk End your voyage in colourful Nuuk Today we arrive in Nuuk, Greenland’s colourful capital. It has a population of 18,000, and boasts a striking mix of old and new buildings. We’ll explore this fascinating city, comparing the old buildings – such as Hans Egede House and Nuuk Cathedral – with the ultra-modern architecture of the Parliament of Greenland. Your voyage ends with a flight from Nuuk to Reykjavík, and an overnight stay. Day 26: Cosmopolitan Reykjavík Discover Iceland's modern capital Enjoy breakfast at the hotel and discover the city before connecting to your onwards flight home. Packed full of art, culture and history, Iceland’s capital is a delight to explore. Visit Laugavegur, the main shopping street, and head towards the striking Hallgrímskirkja church. Or why not explore the many galleries and museums dotted around the city.

Find a store or consultant Send us an enquiry Call 0800 713 715 Book a video call Frequently Asked Questions Planning your cruise How do I choose which type of cruise is right for me There are three main types of cruising Ocean Cruises There is a wide range of itineraries, cruise lines and cruise ships to choose from for those seeking an ocean experience, or an exciting adventure across many countries. Ocean cruising is an amazing holiday where everything you could possibly need is within easy reach. River Cruises A leisurely cruise along the world’s waterways is a relaxing, and luxurious, way to travel. Whether you’re navigating across Europe or cruising Southeast Asia’s Mekong River, each new day on a river cruise brings a new experience. Luxury Cruises Luxury beyond belief. Soak up Michelin-star fine dining restaurants, butler service, and luxurious suites. Luxury cruising appeals to those travellers demanding an unparalleled, all-inclusive travel experience away from the hustle and bustle of the large crowds What types of cruises are there? There are cruises tailored to every type of traveller ie; adults only, couples, families, retirees, singles, large groups etc. Depending on the cruise line will depend on the type of cruise available and what is best suited to the experience you want. Most offer a full range of activities and facilities to participate in as a family. Kids clubs are also offered in some ships and are focused on keeping children entertained. Be prepared, some are more “kid-friendly” than others -always check with your HOT travel consultant Many cruise lines have adults only areas, and some are even fully adults only cruise ships. The larger the ship, the more space you will have. If you are looking for something a little smaller and more intimate, your cruising specialist will help you find that. Can I go on a cruise if I’m travelling alone? Yes - taking a cruise is a great way to relax and see the world at your own pace. A cruise is a fun and safe environment to meet other people, or just soak up the experience solo. Ask your cruise consultant about what’s best for solo travel and find out about the special add on rates for single occupancy of double staterooms. Should I check in before I go YES - we highly recommend checking in online ahead of time. While the process differs between cruise lines, you will usually need to create an account and enter your personal and booking details. It’s a must to do this in advance as you will be provided with a lot of important information to ensure you are fully prepared. This takes the stress out of the boarding process. You may be offered a choice of a few different boarding times, although some cruise lines do pre-allocate this for you. Your check in process will also outline when your bags are likely to be available once you are on board. This is important as it may not be immediately so you might want to reconsider what you take as carry-on so you have some essentials on hand What happens when I embark Like all travel, ensure you arrive at your embarkation port on time (preferably a little earlier) for your allocated boarding time. Make sure you have your boarding passes printed, your luggage tags securely attached to your bags and your passport on hand ready to go. Look out for your designated terminal, drop off your bags, then make your way through the security process. This is very similar to an airport, with metal detectors and x-rays for smaller carry-on bags. Once through security, you will approach the check-in counter, where you will have your photo taken and receive your onboard card, which will serve as your cabin key, onboard payment method and onboard ID. Your luggage will be delivered to your cabin during embarkation. Is cruising expensive? Like all travel, the cost is dependent on a lot of factors – things like the length of cruise, destination(s), the type of cruise line or room type. But because there is so much variety, there will be a cruise to suit everyone's budget. It can work out to be great value for money compared to a regular fly/stay holiday. Will I get seasickness? Most modern cruise ships have stabilizers in place to ensure passenger comfort. Plus, cruise ships will alter their routes in advance to avoid any adverse weather patterns and storms etc. But if you are prone to motion sickness, you could find yourself getting seasick on your cruise holiday. You could try natural remedies or over-the-counter prescribed medicines to counter motion sickness. Do I need a passport or visa to cruise You will require a passport to cruise internationally. Some close to home domestic sailings will only require a valid driver’s license. It is always recommended to have a valid passport whilst cruising and is your responsibility to ensure you have the applicable photo identification. Some countries do require you to obtain a visa in advance if you wish to disembark the ship in port. You will need to check the visa requirements for the countries visited on your cruise itinerary. Countries such as China, Russia, India, Canada and the USA require all New Zealand passport holders to obtain a visa. Always check with your HOT travel consultant and they will direct you to the right information. Will I save money if I book at the last minute or early? We recommend that if you are looking for a great deal book your cruise early. Some cruise lines offer great incentives for the early booking travellers. Thery could be things like complimentary room category upgrades, bonuses and discounted prices. Some even do airline flight credits! But these deals are normally for a limited time and will not last. Join our HOT cruise newsletter / email database, and we will let you know when there are offers or special deals available. Cruise pricing, like most things, reflects supply and demand. The more demand there is for a particular cruise the higher the price will be. Demand could be determined by factors such as the destination, seasons & duration of the cruise holiday. Like anything, waiting till the last minute does involve risk. If you wait, your cruise may have sold out. Then there is also the possibility of getting the cruise but in a room category that you don’t want. Our expert advice is - book early! Onboard your cruise Is there a dress code on board It will depend on what cruise line you are sailing with. As a rule, casual dress is accepted during the day, with smart casual or formal attire being required at night. Most cruise lines do not accept caps, jandals, bare feet, swimwear or sleepwear in formal dining venues. Some cruise lines enforce a stricter dress code, with men required to wear jackets and women cocktail attire at dinner. If you do not comply with your cruise line’s dress code, you may be asked to leave a particular venue. Make sure you check with your HOT travel consultant - you don’t want to get caught out Do cruise ships cater for passengers with accessibility requirement? Yes, most cruise lines have accessibility assistance in place for passengers with disabilities. Cruise ships typically offer a range of wheelchair-accessible cabins, however, the number of these may be limited. You must advise at time of booking – make sure you speak to your HOT travel consultant and outline any requirements for you or your travelling companions Some ocean ships can be large, which at times can be difficult for passengers with mobility problems to navigate. To make things easier, on some cruise ships you can rent a scooter or wheelchair for the duration of your cruise. Always check in advance with your HOT travel consultant Can I smoke onboard a cruise ship? All cabins and public areas onboard cruise ships are strictly non-smoking / vaping. You can, smoke/ vape in the ship’s designated smoking zones only If in doubt, ask the staff onboard your ship. Are my valuables safe on board? If you bring valuables with you, they are best to be kept in your in-room safe. We also recommend you keep your passport, and any important documents locked in the your safe also. Are gratuities or tips included? This depends on the cruise. Your cruise consultant will outline this as part of the booking process. Some holidays include gratuities in the total price, whilst others might require you to pay once you are onboard. How much luggage can I bring on the cruise? Cruise lines are not generally concerned about how much luggage you bring onboard, so there are largely no luggage restrictions on cruise ships. But be aware, some staterooms have limited closet space! But remember, if you are travelling by air etc to your departure port, all airlines have weight and ‘number of bag’ restrictions. Don’t get caught out – make sure you check the details carefully and be aware of any restrictions. Airlines do charge for oversize or excess baggage. Be prepared, check the restrictions with your travel consultant or the airline carrier directly before you book your flights. Should I book shore excursions or do my own sightseeing? Talk to your HOT travel consultant, it depends on what you want to do. You have options – you can do the shore activities arranged directly by the ship, as the quality and service offered is guaranteed. A bonus, if the tour is delayed the ship will wait for you before it sets sail again. You can, however, book shore excursions, whilst on board, or in advance if you want a more structured adventure. Doing your own local sightseeing can be exciting, however you’ll have to pay close attention to time as the ship will not wait for you if you are running late. What currency is used onboard? This varies depending on cruise line and destination. You can almost guarantee that the currency on most cruise lines will not be in NZD. Ships based in Australia will usually have AUD onboard. Ships that cruise in a variety of destinations will have a currency to reflect their company's ownership, which could be currencies such as USD or Euro. Make sure you ask your HOT travel consultant in advance, so you are prepared. What if I require a special diet? If you have special dietary requirements, you should advise your HOT travel consultant at time of booking. If you do have special requirements, make sure you arrange your meals in advance. However, if you do forget, you can arrange it onboard. What room type should I book? A lot of first-time cruisers choose an inside room (internal without a window) mainly due to the cost. However, it is normally only a small difference per day to upgrade to an oceanview room (with a view). Or investigate an upgrade to a balcony/veranda room which offers floor to ceiling windows that open to allow the fresh ocean air in. Check with your HOT travel consultant Can I take visitors on board? Think of a cruise ship like an airplane. No you can’t. Due to immigration and security reasons only registered guests are permitted onboard at all times. Is there babysitting on board? Babysitting is available at extra cost on some ships. Many cruise lines will offer popular kids club facilities onboard, and some cater better than others. But if you are on a cruise that is targeted at families will be spoilt for choice for ways to entertain the whole family Is there WiFI and mobile reception? Yes you can. Most ships offer Wi-Fi throughout the ship, whilst some only offer in designated areas. Most cruise ships have internet cafes on board. Charges do apply for the use of broadband & because it is based on satellite Phone Reception is generally only available in ports. Some cruise lines have agreements with land-based phone service companies. If you chose to use this service, you will be paying international roaming rates for these calls. Find out before you go – your HOT travel consultant can help How do I pay for on board expenses? Just like many hotels, an onboard account will be set up for you prior to departure. This means all your onboard purchases can be charged to this account. Payment will be made at the end of the cruise. Are there laundry services on board? Laundry and cleaning services are always available. It’s either self-service laundry facilities or a professional laundry service. You will find washing machines, dryers, ironing boards, irons and detergent on board. Self-service washing machines & dryers generally tend to be coin operated. Can I bring alcohol onboard the ship? You are not allowed to bring alcohol onboard the ships. Duty free and personal alcohol purchased onshore will be collected upon your check in and can be collected on the last day of your cruise. Any Duty- and Tax-Free alcohol purchased on the ship will be held for safekeeping and can be collected on the last day of the cruise. Not to worry - cruise lines largely offer drink packages so you can purchase drinks onboard. If not, your drinks can be charged to your cruise card. General cruise questions Can I place a deposit for a cruise booking? At time of booking you can choose to pay for the cruise in full or pay the minimum per person deposit amount. When do I need to pay for my cruise in full? If you have chosen to pay a deposit only, your full payment deadline will be determined by the cruise you book, so please check your Invoice for the final payment due date. What is included in the price of a cruise? Cruise holidays are one of the most value for money holidays you could go on. Your transportation, accommodation and main meals are included whilst onboard. Selected activities and entertainment are also included in the price. There are some additional activities that you may have to pay separately for, like special restaurants & shows. Ask your HOT travel consultant for a full list of inclusions and added extras you can pay for separately Do I need travel insurance? YES – we absolutely recommend that you take out comprehensive travel insurance at the time you book your cruise. Your HOT travel consultant can organise a quick and simple quote for you. Can I book my complete holiday including a cruise? Your local HOT travel consultant will be able to curate you the perfect holiday making sure that it all works like clockwork. We can organise your flights, transfers, an amazing cruise, then accommodation and add in extras like a tour, car hire or sightseeing etc. This is where using a HOT travel consultant is critical – it’s complex and our consultants are expert and making it the best holiday ever.
