Day 2 - Discover Colourful Lisbon Dive Into Culture Delve into Lisbon's centuries-old seafaring heritage today, paying tribute to the brave men who set off from these shores to discover the ‘New World’. With our Local Specialist, see the shimmering white Monument to the Discoveries, the iconic suspension bridge spanning the Tagus, and Belém Tower, built as a fortress protecting the city of Lisbon. Dive into Culture on a sightseeing tour of the UNESCO-listed Hieronymite Monastery, an exquisite testament to 16th-century Manueline architecture and art. There’s time to join an Optional Experience to the historic towns of Cascais and Sintra, before perhaps enjoying a traditional Portuguese dinner amidst the soulful and touching sounds of the Fado this evening. Day 3 - Journey to the Algarve Region Connect with Locals Journey across the Tagus this morning and drive south towards the Serra da Arrábida Mountains and to the golden pastures of the Alentejo. The hearty aroma of traditional Portuguese cuisine fills the air at your Be My Guest experience. You'll connect with locals over lunch in the family home of a historic stud ranch, where Lusitano horses were reared for King João VI in the 18th century. Your Portugal trip itinerary continues further south, bound for the sun-kissed shores of the Algarve – your home for the next two nights. Day 4 - Cliffs, Beaches and More in the Algarve Today, visit the historic resort town of Lagos – once home to Henry the Navigator and a key port during the Age of Discovery. Later, stop in the lively coastal town of Albufeira and enjoy some free time to stroll through its charming streets, then enjoy some free time relaxing at the beach or exploring local cafes and shops. Day 5 - Onwards to Elegant Évora Journeying north, travel to the ancient Alentejo city of Évora. Join your Local Specialist for a visit to the elaborate cathedral, Roman temple and the Chapel of Bones. Then, spend the rest of your day delving into the medieval history of this enchanting city. Trace centuries of history along its city walls, kick back with a bica and bolo in Praça do Giraldo or perhaps join an Optional Experience to the medieval village of Monsaraz. This evening you dine at your hotel. Day 6 - Venture Past Mountains to Viseu The first stop today is in the quaint hilltop town of Castelo de Vide with its charming white façades, narrow alleys and fascinating Jewish Quarter. Travel north towards the Serra de Estrela mountains and arrive later in Viseu, set high on a plateau near the famous Dão vineyards. Explore the city's rich art and architectural history, and see the 12th-century Sé, standing imposingly on a hill overlooking much of the city. Day 7 - Through the Douro Valley to Porto Vineyard-clad hills provide an enchanting backdrop for your journey today through the Douro Valley, where Port wine is produced. Explore the magnificent gardens at the Baroque-style Palácio de Mateus, depicted on the label of the distinctive Mateus Rosé wine bottles. Continue via Guimarães for views of its impressive 10th-century castle, before arriving in the riverside town of Porto where you will spend the next two nights. Day 8 - Explore Vibrant Porto Dive Into Culture Join a Local Specialist today for a sightseeing tour in Porto, which takes you past baroque churches and along the winding cobblestone lanes that tumble down towards the Douro River. See the remarkable bridges that span the river and the Gothic Church of St. Francis. Visit the Stock Exchange Palace with its splendid Arabian Hall inspired by Granada's Alhambra, then Dive into Culture and into the centuries-old tradition of local Port production at a tasting in a Port cellar. Spend the rest of the afternoon strolling through the historic centre of Porto admiring the azulejo-clad facades, or visit Livraria Lello, the city's oldest bookstore. Day 9 - On to Coimbra and Pilgrimage to Fátima Soak up the grand atmosphere of one of Europe's greatest and oldest universities with a Local Specialist, then stroll through the ancient streets and squares of Coimbra, before journeying to the Templar city of Tomar. We join a Local Specialist to visit the Convent of Christ, originally built as a Templar stronghold in the 12th century. Later, we arrive in the pilgrimage centre of Fátima, visited by millions of Catholic pilgrims, where three young shepherds famously saw apparitions of the Virgin Mary. Day 10 - Experience Village Life Returning to Lisbon En route to Lisbon, with a Local Specialist, stop at the imposing monastery of Batalha – a UNESCO World Heritage site and the best example of late Gothic architecture in Portugal. Our next stop is the fishing village of Nazaré, before we visit the medieval walled city of Óbidos with its whitewashed houses and cobblestone streets. Celebrate our last evening in Portugal over dinner in a family-run vineyard, a MAKE TRAVEL MATTER® Experience. Toast to an incredible journey over organic wine and locally sourced flavours. Day 11 - Farewell Lisbon Say a fond adeus to your fellow travellers at the end of an unforgettable Portuguese holiday.
