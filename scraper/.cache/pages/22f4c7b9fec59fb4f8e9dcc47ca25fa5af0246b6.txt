Our North America specialists See all See all Rachel Molloy House of Travel Hamilton East Having been in the travel industry for 14 years, it's safe to say travel is my biggest passion. I love turning up somewhere not knowing what to expect and being delighted by both the differences in culture, cuisine and customs. Part way through my career I took a year off and spent this travelling extensively through central America, Asia and Europe. I'm now fortunate enough to be able to pass on the knowledge I've gained over the years and work with my clients to bring their travel dreams to fruition. Rachel Alisha Lockie House of Travel Ferrymead As a travel expert with over 10 years experience in the industry, and a personal passion for adventure, I'm dedicated to helping you create truly unforgettable journeys. Having travelled to 47 countries (and still counting), I bring a wealth of personal experience and industry know-how to help you cut through the noise and explore the world in a way that's tailored just for you. Travel isn't just about booking flights and hotels, it's about navigating the unexpected, something that's more important than ever in today's post-COVID world. With disruptions becoming more common, having an expert on your side can make all the difference. Whether it's rebooking flights, rearranging plans, or finding local solutions, I'll ensure your trip is smooth and stress-free, so you can enjoy every moment. To me, travel is more than seeing new places, it's a chance to connect, learn and grow. Wherever your next adventure takes you, I'll be here to make sure it's stress-free, seamless, and everything you've dreamed of. Alisha Laura Simpson House of Travel Taupo When I first started in the travel industry, I didn’t even have a passport! Fast forward a few months, and that had all changed – I hit the ground running on my first overseas adventure, and I haven’t stopped since. Whether it’s getting immersed in the local culture, or ticking off bucket list moments, travel has a unique magic that stays with you forever. I love using my own travel experience to bring that personal, unique touch to your dream holiday, making a seamless experience from the planning stages right through to your return home. From navigating the bustling metropolis of Hong Kong to exploring the USA on a road trip, there’s a world out there just waiting to be discovered. Let’s have a chat, and make your travel dreams a reality! Laura Courtney McCormack House of Travel Morrinsville Travel is truly in my blood. My grandparents sparked the travel bug in my mum, and she passed that passion on to me. From the moment I took my very first holiday at age three, a magical trip to Disneyland, I was hooked. Growing up, I listened to my mum’s stories from her OE, my cousins’ globe-trotting adventures, and my sister’s explorations, all of which fueled my own wanderlust. Over the years, I’ve lived in Scotland, as well as in England and Ireland, soaking up different cultures and ways of life. I’ve been fortunate to travel extensively, exploring incredible destinations including Jordan, Israel, the USA, Australia & Europe. I’ve experienced the security and ease of organised solo travel with Contiki and Topdeck tours, but I’ve also embraced the challenge and freedom of planning my own trips, like eloping in Denmark, which remains one of my most cherished adventures. With a background in hospitality, I combine practical knowledge with genuine care to craft holidays that are personalised, meaningful, and seamless. I love getting to know your unique travel style and what matters most to you, whether that’s family fun, a romantic escape, or a bucket-list adventure. I’m not just your travel consultant; I’m your travel cheerleader. I’ll celebrate every countdown with you, smooth out any bumps along the way, and be just as excited when everything comes together perfectly. My goal is to take the stress out of travel planning, so you can focus on making memories. Let’s work together to create a travel experience that’s not only unforgettable but uniquely yours.
