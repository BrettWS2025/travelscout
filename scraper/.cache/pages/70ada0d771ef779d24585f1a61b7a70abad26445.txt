We’ll pick you up at Worgl Train Station (included transfer, baby!) and once we’ve all set down our bags at Contiki Haus Schöneck, we’ll kick off the trip officially with a welcome meeting conducted by your Trip Manager. After that, we’ll tuck into an included dinner – made fresh on-site with local ingredients. After dinner, we'll head off for a gentle sunset hike to mark the start of our adventure. Day 2 - Hopfgarten im Brixental After conquering the village trails, it's time to explore Hopfgarten and beyond in a different way; this time on 2 wheels. Join us for a locally guided bike tour through the vibrant green trails, before cruising downhill for a well-earned BBQ lunch. Fancy one last adrenaline hit? You can opt for some tandem paragliding today, soaring over the alps for some peerless panoramas. The adventure has just begun! Day 3 - Hopfgarten im Brixental (Including Haiming & Innsbruck) We’ll start early this morning as we treat ourselves to more of the alps. Next stop? Haiming…Here in Haiming, you can choose to do whatever you like.

We’ll pass through Liechtenstein (AKA one of Europe's smallest countries) along the way, so keep an eye out! Welcome to lush green Lauterbrunnen! We’ll head to our hostel, enjoy a warm, home-cooked dinner then take a short walk the fairytale streets here. Day 5 - Lauterbrunnen Time for some hiking! After breakfast, we’ll take the cable car up the slopes and hike to Murren - a picturesque little village. Enroute back, we'll stop by to visit the jaw-dropping Trummelbach Falls &amp; even devour a delicious packed lunch against the epic Alpine backdrop. Then, it’s back to our hostel on a bus. Mother nature sure does love Switzerland… Day 6 - Lauterbrunnen Wakey wakey, today we’re going to the Top of Europe! Yep. You have the option to visit the picture-perfect Jungfrau mountain. In the afternoon, you can choose to do an epic canyon swing in the mountains, or head back into town to enjoy some ground-level scenery. Afterwards, you can join us for the final dinner of this trip at a local restaurant. Day 7 - Lauterbrunnen Sorry to break it to you, folks! After breakfast, our magical trip will sadly come to an end. So say your goodbyes. And keep reminiscing about your days spent in this nature-kissed wonderland. Don’t worry, there are plenty more jaw-dropping panoramas left for us to explore! More Deals Enquire *Terms and Conditions Offer subject to availability at time of booking.
