What's Included Trip Leader Driver Luxury minicoach 7 nights in thoughtfully selected accommodation 11 meals included (7 breakfasts, 4 dinners) All experiences and entrance fees to sites listed in itinerary Highlights Step back in time at the medieval castle of the enchanting St Michael’s Mount Fall in love with the charm and buzz of historic port towns Padstow and Port Isaac Admire the dramatic cliffs and wild shorelines of the jaw-dropping Jurassic Coast Itinerary Day 1: London You’ll be hard-pressed to find a city as vibrant as London. Before getting to know our small group over a welcome dinner this evening, why not spend a day (or three) admiring England’s capital? You could uncover the East’s buzzing art scene with its plethora of intimate pop-up galleries and vibrant street art. Or, perhaps the West’s renowned shopping districts are calling for a dose of retail therapy at its quirky boutiques and sparkling department stores. And that’s not forgetting the city’s foodie havens and glittering landmarks, of course. The list goes on! Here’s to the start of an incredible week! (D) Day 2: Dartmoor National Park Wave goodbye to towering skyscrapers and sparkling city lights, England’s West Country awaits. Settle into the miniocach as we journey to Wells, which welcomes us with open arms. Often referred to as England’s smallest city, our in-the-know Tour Leader will help us discover its treasures, including the oldest medieval street in Europe and the stately bishop’s residence. The jewel in the crown? The magnificent Wells Cathedral. Step inside this Gothic masterpiece and be awestruck at the nave’s soaring, vaulted arches. Seek out the intricate astronomical clock and listen for its chiming bell that signals the appearance of miniature jousting knights (yes, really!). And bathe in the peaceful, dappled light of the Jesse Window – a multicoloured stained glass marvel. To close today’s chapter, we'll journey from Somerset’s postcard-perfect lanes to Dartmoor National Park’s heather moorland and gorse-clad tors – a landscape that has inspired writers including Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and Agatha Christie. You may also recognise Dartmoor as the setting for several scenes in Steven Spielberg’s War Horse! These sweeping vistas have seen centuries of human activity, from the Bronze Age to the Iron Age and beyond. And as we weave through the undulating open country, keep an eye out for the roaming, semi-wild ponies. They’ve called this place home for over four millennia! This afternoon, step back in time as you settle into our accommodation – an 18th-century coaching inn-turned-hotel that’s just bursting with character. Bask in the glow of its open fireplace with a pint of locally brewed Jail Ale before we gather for dinner with the group, sharing our excitement for the days ahead. (B,D) Day 3: Falmouth Where turquoise waters swell against jagged cliffs, surfers glide like dancers on powerful waves and the masts of sailboats ring like wind chimes in the sea breeze – it's got to be North Cornwall. We’ll get our first taste for Cornish life in Port Isaac, the idyllic fishing village whose whitewashed cottages and winding streets served as the setting for the Doc Martin TV series. As you meander past the slate-fronted houses, melodies of traditional sea shanties drift through the air – did you know the local Fisherman’s Friends folk music group call this place home? Time to warm up those vocal cords... With free time for lunch, you could tuck into a fresh crab sandwich (or two): a true Cornish classic packed with fresh crab meat, crisp lettuce and smooth mayonnaise. Count us in! Then, we’ll travel on to Padstow, a picturesque port town that’s overflowing with bustling cafés, independent shops and sweeping estuary views – not to mention its charming centuries-old harbour. A haven for seafood lovers, celebrity chef Rick Stein has left his mark on the town with his renowned restaurant. Why not spend some time enjoying a traditional cream tea? And let the hubbub of harbourside life unfold before you. (Just remember, the Cornish way to enjoy a freshly baked scone is with jam first, then clotted cream!). To round off our day, we’ll journey to the lively seaside town of Falmouth, our base in South Cornwall for the next two nights. Whether it’s treating yourself to a swim and a pamper in our carefully selected hotel or taking a short stroll into town where you'll find ample options for a delicious dinner, the evening is yours for the taking. (B) Day 4: Falmouth Soak up our hotel’s hundred-year-old history over a hearty breakfast and fuel up for the day ahead – St Michael’s Mount is calling. A tidal island just off the coast of Penzance, its cobbled causeway emerges at low tide, offering an iconic stroll across from the mainland. From the lookouts of its medieval castle, panoramic views of Mount’s Bay greet you – take a moment to fill your lungs with the bracing sea air as the glistening water ripples like oil on canvas. We’ll be setting our sights on West Cornwall and St Ives next, a true gem of the Cornish coast that’s hugged by pristine golden beaches and turquoise water. Meander through the cluster of cobblestone streets, drop in at the Tate art gallery or order a well-earned pint of fruity, Cornish ale at the Sloop Inn pub, one of the oldest in Britain (dating back to 1312, no less). All this exploring is thirsty work after all! Feeling peckish? Well, there’s a Cornish pasty with your name on it. Seek out one of these half-moon-shaped pastries, traditionally filled with beef and vegetables, and you’ll have had a true taste of Cornish culinary heritage. After saying goodbye to St Ives, it's back on our luxury minicoach to Falmouth. We’re treated to a meal at our hotel this evening – a chance to share stories from the day (and favourite pasty flavours) with the group. (B,D) Day 5: St Austell Bay There’s a real treat in store for the green-fingered: we’re off to explore Tregothnan Estate, one of Cornwall’s largest estates and home to the first tea plantation in Britain. A member of the gardening team will give us a private tour of the grounds and the plantation, where we’ll learn all about the only tea grown in England – from the first tea bushes planted in 1999 to the unique conditions needed to cultivate perfect leaves. After sampling, and filling our bags with, some of this uniquely British produce (for a taste of Cornwall back home, of course), we’ll tear ourselves away from the serene riverside setting and journey on to the St Austell Bay area. Our home for the next two nights is nothing short of picture-perfect. Our thoughtfully-chosen hotel is perched on the cliffside, offering mesmerising views of the Cornish coastline that we’ve come to know and love. Dinner is yours for the taking this evening, and you’ll be spoilt for choice at our hotel’s award-winning restaurant. (B) Day 6: St Austell Bay Today, you’re free to write your own chapter in this captivating corner of Cornwall. If you fancy a walk, you could wander down to UNESCO World Heritage-listed Charleston harbour, where handmade dairy ice creams and classic filming locations await (Poldark, anyone?). Or perhaps you could spend some time connecting with nature at the world-famous Eden Project. Often hailed as the ‘eighth wonder of the world’, its two tropical biomes are teeming with an abundance of lush plants and towering trees around every turn, and even the odd lizard or two... As another option, why not simply indulge in the comforts of our luxurious hotel? Whether it’s relaxing by the pool, pampering yourself at the spa, playing a round of golf or just drinking in the fresh, sea air as you weave your way through the 250 acres of private grounds, our accommodation is a true haven for rest and relaxation. This evening, as night casts its spell over the bay, raise a glass to another brilliant day. Watch the sun dip below the horizon, transforming the sea from azure blue to molten silver. (B) Day 7: Salisbury The striking red cliffs of the Jurassic Coast are calling! But not before we pay a visit to Buckfast Abbey, a working Benedictine monastery, where you can take a moment to pause under the vaulted arches of its impressive church. Then, it’s time to follow in the footsteps of Mary Anning in Lyme Regis, the pioneering palaeontologist who called this quaint coastal town home. As you etch your way along the beach, be on the lookout for fossils from around 200 million years ago (yes, really!) that are often revealed by the crumbling cliffs or washed up on the shoreline. From ammonites to belemnites, these marine relics offer a glimpse into Earth’s prehistoric past. Our final dinner is waiting for us in Salisbury. Swap contact details and photos with the group, and give a hearty ‘cheers’ to the memories made.(B,D) Day 8: London Listen to the patter of footsteps in hushed cloisters, gaze up at the tallest spire in Britain and cast your eyes over the legendary Magna Carta – Salisbury Cathedral beckons! Spot the pointed arches, flying buttresses and intricate stonework that solidify the cathedral as an early Gothic architectural feat before we travel back to London to say our goodbyes. While we may be bidding farewell to our Cornish adventure, the region’s magic is sure to leave an indelible mark. (B) Terms & Conditions Fares are in NZD per person, twin share.
