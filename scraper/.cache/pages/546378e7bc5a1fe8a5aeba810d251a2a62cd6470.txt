Check in to your hotel, then take some time to recharge siesta-style before meeting your Travel Director and fellow travellers this evening for a glimpse of what lies ahead. There's boundless energy to Barcelona and you'll want to soak it all up on your first evening in the capital of Catalonia. Day 2 Barcelona sightseeing and free time This morning consider joining a Choice Experience to Montserrat with its hidden monastery, home to the revered "La Moreneta". Then gear up for sightseeing in Barcelona, joining your Local Guide who knows all the best spots in town. Capture the sights and sounds of Las Ramblas, Passeig de Gràcia and view the facade of the ornate La Sagrada Família as you tour the city. Spend the rest of your day exploring on your own.

Later opt into a scenic drive of Montjuïc, host to the 1992 summer Olympics, before indulging in a delightful Catalonian feast with drinks. Day 3 Barcelona - Peñíscola - Valencia Today we'll skirt along the Costa Dorada, a gleaming strip of the Mediterranean coastline, travelling past expansive orange groves to Peñíscola. You'll see its imposing 13th-century Templar Castle, famed as the dramatic backdrop for the Hollywood classic El Cid. Then continue to Valencia, catching a glimpse of the iconic highlights of this bustling modern metropolis on your orientation tour with your Travel Director. View the Art Nouveau, Train Station Estación del Norte, the Towers of Serrano and Quart. Next, leave the present behind and admire the futuristic 'City of Arts and Sciences', a cultural complex built into the Turia riverbed. Day 4 Valencia - Guadix - Granada Today we journey to the foothills of the Sierra Nevada and pass by a hidden underground world of cave houses. You'll have the chance to capture this curiosity on camera, then continue your scenic travels to Granada, the last stronghold of the Moors in Spain. Day 5 Granada - Costa del Sol Embrace the laid-back spirit of your Spanish hosts and enjoy a slow start to the day on your Mediterranean tour. Spend your free morning exploring Granada and its Moorish influences on your own. There's even time for a quick tea break at a traditional tetería or you may choose to join an Optional Experience to the Albaicín Quarter, one of the oldest centres of Islamic culture in the city. Later, we head to the golden beaches of the Costa del Sol. Set your watch to siesta time or don your sandals and sunglasses for a leisurely stroll to soak up the fresh sea air. Day 6 Costa del Sol - Gibraltar - Seville Explore a slice of Britain when you cross the border into Gibraltar, the much-contested gateway to the Mediterranean Sea. Maybe join a Choice Experience to get up close to the Barbary apes and visit the cave of St. Michael at the Rock of Gibraltar, the Roman and Greeks' former pillar of the "known world". Next, we return to Spain, travelling north through the Andalusian countryside to sizzling Seville. Day 7 Seville sightseeing and free time A Local Guide is on hand today to reveal Seville's special allure and, standing amidst the pavilions and fountains of Maria Luisa Park, you'll hear all about the elaborate Ibero-American Exposition of 1929 which put this sleepy Spanish city on the global map. See the world's largest Gothic Cathedral and its Giralda Bell Tower, then consider joining a Choice Experience to the Alcázar, built by a Christian king who loved Mudéjar architecture.

Day 8 Seville - Lisbon The highlights of your Spain and Portugal value tour just keep on rolling and for now it's adiós Sevilla and a warm olá to Portugal, as we journey through the golden and green plains of the Alentejo to Lisbon. Pastel and azulejo-clad façades line the Portuguese capital's narrow streets which ramble across and over its seven hills from St. George Castle to the Tagus River. You'll be drawn to the city's vibrant nightlife in the Bairro Alto and beyond, so head out with new friends for a night on the town or join your Travel Director for a poignant Choice Experience including a traditional meal accompanied by the authentic sounds of Fado.

You could choose to leave the city limits behind this afternoon and visit the beach playgrounds of Estoril and Cascais, as well as Sintra, on a Choice Experience of the iconic Golden Triangle - the choice is yours. Day 10 Lisbon - Fátima - Salamanca Rub shoulders with visiting travellers who have made the journey to the Catholic pilgrimage centre of Fátima. It was here in 1917 that the Virgin Mary is said to have appeared to three shepherd children. Today this humble village has been transformed into a place celebrating a religious miracle.

Admire views of the Royal Palace and El Retiro Park, originally created as a retreat for the Royal Family.

You'll have a full free day to explore the city your way and discover the legacy of 'Madrid's Best Mayor', who helps the city become one of the most gracious capitals across Europe.
