Day 2 - Discover the Icons of Beijing Delve into Beijing&rsquo;s rich imperial heritage, beginning your encounter with the remnants of centuries-old dynasties in the world&rsquo;s largest public space, Tiananmen Square. Tread in the footsteps of emperors, passing through the south gate to the UNESCO-listed Forbidden City, the imperial palace for emperors and their households for over five centuries. Immerse yourself in the ancient rituals, traditions and history of this palace complex before lunch. Continue to the tranquil Temple of Heaven, another UNESCO Heritage Site, once visited by the emperors of the Ming and Qing dynasties to pray for good harvests and divine guidance. This evening, the salty, sweet flavours of succulent Peking Duck take centre stage during a Regional Dinner. Day 3 - Journey to the Great Wall We leave the city behind, bound for the iconic Great Wall of China at Juyongguan. Standing on its ramparts, we look down on the Chinese countryside which its walls successfully defended against marauding nomadic invaders. Watch it snake thousands of miles into the distance as you imagine how these man-made fortifications were built and rebuilt from the 5th century B.C. to the 16th century. Then, walk the Sacred Way past the imposing stone statues that guard the Ming Tombs and remains of 13 emperors of the Ming Dynasty. Day 4 - Explore Beijing Connect with Locals Dive Into Culture A leisurely start to our morning sees us embark on a rickshaw tour around the ancient narrow alleyways of the courtyard Hutong residences. Connect with the local culture as you join a family for a delicious meal of traditional Chinese cuisine at a Be My Guest lunch, followed by a visit to a tea house, where a Local Specialist prepares and serves tea, explaining the historic tea-making ritual. This afternoon, you’ll indulge in a relaxing foot massage at the Foot Reflexology Centre. Day 5 - Travel to Xi'an We fly to Xi’an, which reveals its role as the ancient departure point of the Silk Road. Visit the Great Mosque, one of the oldest, largest and best-preserved mosques in China. According to historical records it was built in 742 during the Tang Dynasty and is a combination of Islamic art and traditional Chinese architecture. Day 6 - Uncover Xi'an's Treasures Make Travel Matter Start your day at the Tang Dynasty Gallery, where you’ll explore China’s artistic legacy. Dive into Culture at a traditional calligraphy class, where you’ll try your hand at Chinese writing using a brush and ink, an art form dating back to the Han Dynasty. Step inside ancient cave dwellings on a MAKE TRAVEL MATTER® Experience in the Loess Plateau, built from naturally insulating, earthquake-resistant earth, and see firsthand how local families are preserving their heritage while adapting to modern life. History comes to life as you stand before the UNESCO-listed Terracotta Warriors, a silent army guarding China’s first emperor for over two millennia. After a delicious bowl of traditional Chinese noodles, visit a local jade workshop to uncover the craftsmanship behind this treasured stone. Day 7 - Onwards to Shanghai Dive Into Culture Stays With Stories This morning, your choice of activities gives you an opportunity to mimic the graceful movements of a skilled T’ai Chi Local Specialist, or consider joining a cycle tour around part of the ancient City Wall of Xi'an. Later at a local restaurant, you will be watching a demonstration in the art of making dumplings, with an opportunity to sample these for lunch. Savour the juicy flavours of these boiled, steamed and fried treats, transporting you back to ancient China, before transferring to the airport for your flight to Shanghai. Ascend to the 88-storey Jinmao Tower for panoramic views of the skyscrapers that loom over the most populous city on earth. Day 8 - Experience Shanghai Dive Into Culture Stroll down Shanghai’s famous ‘Bund’ with a Local Specialist, admiring the neoclassical colonial buildings that have lined this city’s renowned waterfront since the early 1900s.

In its heyday, Zhujiajiao was a bustling market town. Today, old historical buildings such as rice shops, banks, spice stores and even a Qing Dynasty post office can still be found as you stroll down its ancient streets and wander across the many stone bridges that crisscross its canals. This afternoon, you’ll have some free time to explore the city or simply relax before joining your travel companions for dinner.
