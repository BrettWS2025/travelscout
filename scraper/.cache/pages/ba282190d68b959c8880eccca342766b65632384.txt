Visit the world famous Bridge over the River Kwai, a part of Death Railway constructed by Allied POWs in World War II which has seen its share of conflict and bloodshed. Enjoy your lunch at a local restaurant. After lunch, continue on to Hellfire Pass Memorial, it is a part of the Death Railway that was built cruelly by prisoners of war during the World War II.

In the village, the Mon still live a traditional, simple life. They make almost no use of electricity. The village has been adapted a bit to tourism, with the people selling traditional skirts and foods to their visitors. When walking through the village, one can visit the Golden Rock , the temple and see the traditional houses on poles, which keep them safe from the water during raining season. Return to the rafts for lunch and enjoy your afternoon at leisure till your dinner time. Dinner and overnight at the River Kwai Jungle Rafts.

Then journey back to Bangkok and transfer to your accommodation in Bangkok center. Your accommodation: River Kwai Jungle Rafts is an ideal destination for everyone who seeks not only a magical place to get away to but also a legend to be experienced. You will enjoy the stunning nature surroundings of tropical forest and a unique blend of the culture and tradition of Mon people, and the history of World War II history that took place in the nearby area.
