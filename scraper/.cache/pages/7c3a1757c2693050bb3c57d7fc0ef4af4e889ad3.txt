You'll also learn how to drive your own husky-sled through the Lappish wilderness, snowmobile through glittering forest trails and say hello to Santa when he visits on Christmas Eve.

At the reindeer farm you will learn interesting information about the reindeer and the life of a reindeer herder and Sami culture. There will be also possibility for a short reindeer sledge ride during your visit at the farm. This guided trip will be made by car. Later in the day, the magic begins with a visit to Santa! After a snowmobile sleigh ride to his secret hideaway, families will enjoy a warm and personal meeting with Santa, who will share small gifts with everyone. To make the experience even more memorable, we invite families to submit children's letters to Santa at reception at least one day in advance—this allows Santa to read them beforehand and add a personal touch to each encounter. (B,L,D) Day 3: Husky Safari & Aurora excursion An absolute ‘must do’ when visiting Lapland! You will be taught how to handle the sled before heading out on the husky safari, where the huskies will pull your sled through the beautiful winter scenery, passing along frozen Lake Inari. The dogs’ excitement is infectious but they fall silent on the trail, this is the only way to see Lapland. All our husky safaris include full instructions and are based on two people sharing a sled unless otherwise stated. This evening after dinner, dress warmly and head out to the Aurora Camp, an all-time favorite among our guests. This trip takes you to one of the specifically chosen camp spots, where you will try to catch the northern lights. You will be comfortably seated in a sledge, pulled by a guide’s snowmobile. We will have open fire and warm drinks while waiting for the sky to show its magic. (B,L,D) The excursions on days 2, 3 & 4 may occur in a different order, depending on availability, timings and weather, but all are included in your stay.
