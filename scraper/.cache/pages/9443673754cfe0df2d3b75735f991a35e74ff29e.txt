Airfares & transfers are additional. Itinerary Fall in love with the dramatic landscapes and rich cultures of Europe. Lose yourself among the cobbled roads, colourful buildings, and incredible vistas in Villefranche-sur-Mer - a picturesque town situated along the French Riviera - or recline on one of the nearby idyllic beaches. Nestled on the west coast of Tuscany, charming Livorno offers the freshest seafood, awe-inspiring forts and splendid coastal views with ample cafes and boutiques that await your discovery. Then outside of Messina, you can step back in time with a visit to two enchanting medieval villages, Taormina and Castelmola, that are set upon dramatic cliffs overlooking the sea. Show more Day 1 Barcelona, Spain The capital of Catalonia, and one of its provinces, Barcelona, is a place of palpable history, where you can lose yourself strolling down the medieval streets of the Barri Gotic. It's a city designed to delight the senses: visit other-worldly Modernista churches like Gaudi's La Sagrada Familia, or treat yourself at a street side cafe to Patatas Bravas or a Passion Fruit Mojito. Day 2 Provence (Marseille), France Marseille, a port city in southern France, has been a crossroads of immigration and trade since its founding by the Greeks circa 600 B.C. At its heart is the Vieux-Port (Old Port), where fishmongers sell their catch along the boat-lined quay. Basilique Notre-Dame-de-la-Garde is a Romanesque-Byzantine church. Modern landmarks include Le Corbusier's influential Cité Radieuse complex and Zaha Hadid's CMA CGM Tower. Day 3 Nice / Monaco (Villefranche-Sur-Mer), France Villefranche is an enchanting example of the French Riviera's allure that's nestled a mere 6km east of Nice. Stroll along the Old Harbour for majestic views of the Mediterranean. Saint Michael's Church houses many incredible artworks and an 18th-century organ constructed by the Grinda Brothers. Relax on one of the local beaches or trek up to the Fort Du Mont Alban, a 16th-century structure overlooking the city. For some subterranean scenery, head to the Rue Obscure under the city or the prehistoric archeological site at Grotte du Lazaret. Day 4 Florence / Pisa (Livorno), Italy How lucky to visit the Tuscan region, Florence & Pisa, resplendent in art and history. What's even more fortunate is that all the main attractions in Florence are centrally located for the perfect walking tour. See Santa Croce, Piazza del Duomo and Michelangelo's David. Day 5 At Sea Day at sea - enjoy the ship's amenities and relax as you cruise to your next destination. Day 6 Messina, Sicily The third largest city on the island of Sicily, Messina welcomes cruise ship visitors with its lovely harbour, extraordinary architecture and wonderful food. Stroll through Messina's Piazza Cairoli taking in magnificent fountains and cathedrals, or sip Marsala wine at a sidewalk cafe. Explore more of Messina on a European cruise! Day 7 Salerno, Italy Nestled between the mountains and the sea at the southeastern point of the famed Amalfi Coast, Salerno boasts sun-drenched beaches, nature reserves and parks, historic sites and delicious local cuisine. Day 8 Rome (Civitavecchia), Italy Endless adventures await in Rome. With two and a half thousand years of history, art and culture, it is no wonder Rome is one of the most visited cities on the planet. Gaze at the masterpieces of the Vatican or walk into the past with visits to ancient relics, historic monuments and legendary museums. Or people-watch while sipping on an espresso in a quaint cafe.
