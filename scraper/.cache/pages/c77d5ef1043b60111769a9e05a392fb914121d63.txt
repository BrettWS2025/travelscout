Itinerary Day 1 (campsite) Depart Johannesburg at 6.30am. Head north and cross the border into Botswana. Game drive in Khama Rhino Sanctuary and overnight. Day 2 (campsite) Drive through the Kalahari to Maun and the gateway to the Okavango Delta by late afternoon. There is the option to join the tour today and skip two long driving days by flying into Maun airport. Day 3-5 (wild camping x 2 nights, campsite x 1 night) Two nights wild camping in the Okavango Delta that we will reach by local mokoro (dug-out) canoe. Explore by mekoro and on foot with our local poler guides as we explore their ‘big backyard.’ The delta forms as water flows from the Angolan highlands out over the Botswanan flat Kalahari Desert sands creating a delicate, green oasis for birds & wildlife. We will camp wild on remote islands in this amazingly dynamic environment & enjoy bush walks, bird watching & swimming in the clear water. There is time for an optional game flight over the Delta before we return to Maun for a night to prepare for our next adventure. Day 6-9 (wild camping x 4 nights) We have 4 nights in these conservation areas camping in exclusive operator sites, so there will just be our group, surrounded by wilderness. We spend our time on game drives watching the plentiful wildlife including wild dog, elephant, hippo, buffalo, lion & other game. Moremi Game Reserve rates as one of the leading wildlife areas of the world and we take our open 4WD vehicle into Moremi for fantastic game viewing! Grasslands, floodplains, forests, lily lagoons and winding water channels combine to form a variety of game viewing habitats. Moving north over the sand ridge and into the Mababe depression we arrive at the Savuti Marsh. This open grassland area attracts herds of zebra and wildebeest, which in turn draw the large lion prides for which Savuti is famous. We camp wild in the central Chobe National Park at either Savuti or Zwei-Zwei. Day 10-11 (wild camping x 1 night, campsite x 1 night) We head to the northern reaches of Chobe National Park wild camping for one night and staying at designated camp site in Kasane on day 11. We will enjoy an afternoon cruise on the river in a small game viewing boat. You are assured of some up-close sightings of the wildlife in and around the river. Day 12-13 (lodge x 2 nights) Leave Botswana and cross into Zambia and drive to Livingstone. The mighty Zambezi River thunders 100m over the gorge creating a magnificent spectacle. Explore Victoria Falls on foot. There is a free day to make the most of the many adventure activities available in and around the Falls. Day 14 Your safari ends this morning. Airport transfers are available. On selected dates there is an option to join a 15 day safari through Namibia, a 12 day safari in Zambia & Malawi or a longer 22 day option of Zambia, Malawi, Mozambique and Kruger for circular safari back to Johannesburg.
