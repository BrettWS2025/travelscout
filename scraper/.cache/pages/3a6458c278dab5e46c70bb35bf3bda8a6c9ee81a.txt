Uluru Sacred Sites and Sunset Travel in the comfort of your coach around the base of Uluru with your Driver Guide who will provide details on its incredible history. You’ll be fascinated by the Aboriginal stories that go back many thousands of years. Learn the significance of ancient Aboriginal rock art, about the area’s flora and fauna, and culture of its traditional owners, the Anangu. Your day concludes with a spectacular sunset at Uluru. Kings Canyon and Outback Panoramas Tour You’ll get a sense of the remoteness of outback Australia as you travel to Kings Canyon. Located in the heart of Watarrka National Park, it lies in an ancient Australian landscape that is sacred ground for the Ulpanyali and Lilla people. The Rim Walk is a once-in-a-lifetime experience. The climb up a 100-metre cliff face reveals views of sandstone walls, grottos, chasms and cliffs. Or, for something more relaxing, set off on a two-kilometre stroll along the creek bed that leads to impressive views of the canyon rim.
