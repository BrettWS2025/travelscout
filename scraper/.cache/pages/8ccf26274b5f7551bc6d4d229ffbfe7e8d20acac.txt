Embark on a luxurious expedition aboard the Ocean Albatros, where you’ll journey to a remote beach on Northeast Greenland, perfectly positioned to experience the total eclipse on August 12, 2026. At 16:37, the shadow of the moon will envelop the dramatic Blosseville Coast, with the total eclipse lasting 2 minutes and 17 seconds. Departing from Reykjavik, Iceland’s vibrant capital, your voyage will take you directly to the eclipse zone, where you'll witness this celestial marvel amidst breathtaking landscapes. Following the eclipse, you’ll sail south along Greenland’s eastern coast, marvelling at glaciers descending from the snow-capped peaks of the Watkins Mountains, exploring the unique culture of East Greenland in Tasiilaq, and taking in the stunning fjords and glaciers of Skjoldungen. Your journey continues through the impressive Prins Christiansund strait, bordered by glaciers, which separates Greenland’s southernmost point, Kap Farvel, from the mainland. You’ll venture into South Greenland’s fjords to uncover the ancient remnants of Erik the Red's farmstead, discovering why the Norse settlers named the island Greenland and chose to settle in its lush paradise. You’ll also visit Nuuk, one of the world’s smallest capitals, where traditional wooden houses blend with modern structures, and local markets feature seal and whale meat. Navigate the Evighedsfjord, or “Fjord of Eternity,” where numerous glaciers cascade from rugged peaks. Aboard the Ocean Albatros, enjoy exceptional comfort, gourmet dining, and insightful lectures, enhancing this once-in-a-lifetime voyage to witness totality on Earth’s largest island. Pricing Category Pricing* Porthole Cabin $29,490* Premium Suite $59,490* *Pricing per person, twin share, is an indication only - subject to USD currency fluctuation Itinerary Details Day 1: Reykjavik, Iceland Dominated by the striking columns of Hallgrímskirkja Church, Reykjavik is a vibrant Scandinavian capital with a reputation for its modern Nordic cuisine, excellent shopping, exciting excursions, and laid-back atmosphere. As one of Scandinavia's most welcoming cities, Reykjavik invites exploration of its eclectic museums, local sweater shops, or simply enjoying the city's lively scene from a cozy café terrace. At the bustling Reykjavik harbour, the MV Ocean Albatros awaits. With staterooms prepared, you will embark after a mandatory safety briefing and lifeboat drill. Your journey will then set sail towards the rugged east coast of Greenland. Day 2: Crossing the Denmark Strait The Denmark Strait, the narrow section of the North Atlantic Ocean separating Iceland from Greenland, is renowned for its productive waters. Here, the cold East Greenland Current meets the warm Gulf Stream, creating nutrient-rich waters that support a diverse array of marine life, including fish, seals, whales, and seabirds. As you navigate this strait, eclipse experts will monitor weather and ice conditions at the eclipse viewing location and brief guests on safe viewing and photography practices. They will also provide insights into the region’s ecology, geology, and wildlife, while preparing for the adventure ahead. Day 3: Eclipse Day – Blosseville Coast, East Greenland In the early hours, you will approach the dramatic Blosseville Coast. Once feared by sailors for its treacherous sea ice, this coastline is now accessible thanks to warmer temperatures and advanced marine technology. For the eclipse, Viva Expeditions have chosen a prime viewing spot as close to the eclipse centerline as possible, with unobstructed views and easy Zodiac access. The Ocean Albatros will anchor near the shore around noon, allowing time for guests to set up their equipment and prepare for the eclipse. At 16:37 local time, the partial eclipse will begin, with totality starting at 17:37. The sun will be in the southwestern sky, unobstructed by mountains. At 17:40, the “Diamond Ring” effect will appear as the first rays slip past the lunar disk, marking the end of totality around 18:33. After the eclipse, you will return to the ship for a special gala dinner. Eclipse Photography Tip: Capturing the eclipse can be challenging and requires advanced equipment. To fully experience the unique atmosphere of a total solar eclipse, consider focusing on observing the light changes in the landscape rather than just photographing the event. Always use the provided solar eclipse glasses when looking at the sun. Day 4: Along the Blosseville Coast The Ocean Albatros will head south along the Blosseville Coast, known for its dramatic rock formations and volcanic history. This region, shaped by the opening of the Atlantic Ocean and volcanic activity millions of years ago, is a magnet for geologists and was first explored by Danish explorer Ejnar Mikkelsen. If conditions permit, the ship may attempt a shore landing at Kangerlussuaq, meaning "Big Fjord" in Greenlandic. Despite the harsh weather, the region has been inhabited for thousands of years, with remnants of Inuit settlements and expedition huts dotting the landscape. Day 5: Tasiilaq, East Greenland Your journey continues to Tasiilaq, East Greenland's largest settlement. This region remained relatively isolated until a Danish trading post was established in 1894. The East Greenlandic culture, distinct from other parts of Greenland, retains ancient traditions, including the creation of tupilak, carved monsters from animal or human parts. Tasiilaq, located on Ammassalik Island, offers a rugged landscape with numerous sled dogs and excellent hiking opportunities. Explore the city’s museum, enjoy a performance by the local choir, or visit the Stunk Artist's Workshop for unique local crafts. Day 6: Skjoldungen & Saqqisikuik You’ll sail into the stunning Skjoldungen fjord, named after a Norse king. This uninhabited fjord features dramatic landscapes with towering granite mountains and glaciers. A visit to the Thryms Glacier and the glacial valley of Dronning Maries Dal provides opportunities for scenic hikes and exploration. Day 7: Prins Christian Sund – Aappilattoq South of Skjoldungen, you will navigate the spectacular Prins Christian Sund, a 60 km waterway known for its dramatic mountain scenery and year-round ice-free conditions. In the afternoon, you will visit Aappilattoq, a tranquil village at the end of the strait. Aappilattoq offers excellent hiking and a renowned local choir, providing a peaceful contrast to the larger towns of Greenland. Day 8: Tasermiut and Uunartoq Tasermiut fjord, often compared to Yosemite for its sheer granite cliffs, offers breathtaking views and a short hike to enjoy its beauty. The Norse settlers named it Ketil’s Fjord, and remnants of their presence can still be found. In the evening, you’ll visit Uunartoq, famous for its geothermal springs. Unlike Iceland, Uunartoq allows for a unique experience of relaxing in hot springs with icebergs floating nearby. You’ll enjoy a Zodiac landing and a dip in the natural hot pool. Day 9: Qassiarsuk and Itilleq Kukalleq You will cruise to Qassiarsuk, where Norse explorer Erik the Red settled a thousand years ago. The site of his farmstead, Brattahlíð, includes remnants of the first church in the Americas built by his wife Thjodhild. Across the fjord lies Itilleq, with a trail leading to Igaliku and the ruins of the Norse Bishop’s palace at Garðar, once a powerful center in the Norse world. Day 10: Sailing Towards Nuuk You will sail north along Greenland’s rugged coastline. The west coast’s warm Atlantic currents make it a prime area for spotting whales, seals, and seabirds. Keep an eye out for wildlife as you traverse these rich waters. Day 11: Nuuk, Capital of Greenland Nuuk, a blend of skyscrapers and traditional wooden houses, offers a mix of cosmopolitan and quaint experiences. The city’s history includes Paleo-Inuit cultures, Norse colonists, and modern Inuit life. Visit the Greenlandic National Museum, the Katuaq cultural center, and local boutiques, or simply enjoy a coffee while observing the city’s vibrant activity. Day 12: Kangaamiut and Evighedsfjorden Your final full day includes a visit to Kangaamiut, a picturesque village in the Qeqqata region. Traditional lifestyles and local art are highlights, and a hike offers panoramic views of the fjord. In the afternoon, you’ll explore Evighedsfjorden (Eternity Fjord), a vast fjord stretching 100 km into the glacier-clad mountains. A Zodiac cruise will allow you to view the Evigheds Glacier and observe wildlife along the way. Day 13: Kangerlussuaq – Disembarkation As you sail up Kangerlussuaq Fjord overnight, you will disembark after breakfast and bid farewell to the crew and fellow travellers. Kangerlussuaq, with its military history and natural beauty, provides a final glimpse of Greenland before you conclude your Arctic adventure at the modern airport terminal, taking home memories to last a lifetime.
