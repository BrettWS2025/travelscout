This 4.5 to 5-hour journey offers opportunities to visit Shell Beach, Hamelin Pool stromatolites, and striking desert scenery along the way. Upon arrival, check in to your Beach View Room at the Monkey Mia Dolphin Resort & Lodge, your home for the next two nights.

Back at the resort, unwind with a sunset dinner on the beach or a peaceful walk along the shoreline. Day 6: Drive to Kalbarri Leave Monkey Mia and travel south to Kalbarri, a journey of approximately 4.5 hours.
