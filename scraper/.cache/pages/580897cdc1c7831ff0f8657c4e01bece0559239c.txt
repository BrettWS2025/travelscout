Day 2: Colombo – Sinharaja After breakfast proceed to Sinharaja Rain forest. Trekking through this magnificent jungle, the last surviving stretch of virgin rainforest on the island is a truly enriching experience. From top to bottom, the forest is teeming with life, colour and sound to stir the senses. Sinharaja is a UNESCO International Man and Biosphere Reserve. Stay overnight in Sinharaja. (B, D) Day 3: Udawalawe & Bundala After breakfast, we proceed to Udawalawa National Park with a packed breakfast. An estimated 500 elephants in herds of up to 1,000 live here and the dry season is the best time to watch them. Enjoy a safari to see families of elephants bathing and playing. Stay overnight in Udawalawe. (B, D) Day 4: Udawalawe – Yala Wake up early for a safari at Bundala National Park. Bundala wetlands combine 20km of beach, lagoons and scrub hosting more than 150 bird species. These wetlands are home to winter migratory birds and flocks of flamingos. A vast concentration of Estuarine crocodiles lives in the lagoon areas and the estuary of the Kirindi Oya river. Later return to the hotel for breakfast and travel to Yala. Stay two nights in Yala. (B, D) Day 5: Yala First thing in the morning will be your best chance to see a leopard as you enjoy a safari at Yala National Park. The male leopards in Yala are very confident animals and seem to have no fear of the jeep, leading to some excellent photographic opportunities. The park is also home to spotted deer, sambar, boar, wild buffaloes, sloth bear, jackal and mongoose. (B, D) Day 6: Yala - Nuwara Eliya Travel to Nuwara Eliya, en-route visit a tea plantation and a tea factory, where the best Ceylon Tea in the world is produced.

The starting point is marked by a gate and a little pond and further up you’ll find a resting station before you start the trek, 10 km of it. Once you reach the “world’s end” you’ll experience the cloud forest. Wait for the clouds to part to reveal the great vista of the valley spreading for miles below. Further on, you’ll have to make an arduous climb down to see Baker Falls. Later travel to Kandy and if time permits, we visit the sacred Temple of the Tooth Relic. Stay overnight in Kandy. (B, D) Day 8: Wasgamuwa & Knuckle Proceed to Wasgamuwa via Knuckles Valley, a major eco-tourism area containing five major forest formations, a wide variety of endemic flora and fauna and some breath-taking mountain scenery.
