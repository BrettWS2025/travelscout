Then consider joining the optional excursion afterward to the Skylon Tower for more amazing views of the Falls and a buffet lunch before returning to Toronto.

At Rockport, board your boat for a cruise that takes a scenic route through the many islands that are sprinkled with charmingly simple to opulent summer homes. Next, head to Ottawa, Canada’s beautiful capital. Day 4 Ottawa This morning, enjoy a sightseeing tour of this lovely city on the banks of the Ottawa River and the Rideau Canal. See the Royal Canadian Mint, the embassy district, and stately Parliament Hill. Suggestions for this afternoon include a visit to the magnificent Canadian Museum of History or perusing the array of restaurants and shops at lively Byward Market.

Visit Notre Dame du Cap de la Madeleine and its Basilica and learn of its miraculous past. Follow the historic King’s Highway along the north shore of the mighty St. Lawrence River before arriving in Québec City, the heart of French Canada and a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The rest of the day is free. Tonight, join a unique optional excursion to the Érablière le Chemin du Roy Sugar Shack to learn how maple syrup is made and enjoy a traditional Québec dinner. Day 6 Québec City Area Enjoy a guided tour of Canada’s only walled city, crowned by the turrets of Château Frontenac. Until the British victory of 1759, Old Québec was the center of New France; today, it’s a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Within the walls reside Place d’Armes, Laval Seminary, the star-shaped Citadelle, and ancient Place Royale. Also, see the stone houses crowding the narrow streets of Lower Town by the St. Lawrence River. The afternoon and evening are free.
