Please check price at time of booking Itinerary Day - 1 Location: Quito - Bienvenidos! Welcome to Ecuador. Your adventure begins in Quito – Ecuador’s sprawling capital city. You’ll have a welcome meeting at 5 or 6 pm tonight to meet your local leader and small group of fellow travellers. If you arrive early, maybe check out the city at your own pace – head to the Old Town and pick one (or more) of the 30 churches to explore. After your meeting, you’ll head to a small, local restaurant for dinner with your group. Take in the aromas and fresh flavours of the traditional Ecuadorian cuisine – think locroc (traditional potato soup) or quinoa, pork and vegetable dishes cooked with herbs, lemongrass and rich sauces, all sourced from local farms. Day - 2 Location: Quito/Isla San Cristobal - You have a very early start this morning (maybe as early as 4 am, depending on flight times) as you head into the Galapagos. Transfer to Mariscal Sucre International Airport (Quito Airport), with a boxed breakfast on the way. When you arrive, you’ll meet your naturalist guide in the arrival hall. Then, head to the Grande Daphne and have lunch with your shipmates. Your first stop is the San Cristobal Interpretation Center, which brings the history and geography of the archipelago to life, from its volcanic origins to the present day. This afternoon, there will be an opportunity to travel to the highlands to see giant tortoises in a protected area. Day - 3 Location: Isla Santa Fe/Isla Plaza Sur - Sea lions, iguanas and hawks – oh my! Isla Santa Fe is home to all three, plus Galapagos mockingbirds, marine turtles, frigate birds, Galapagos doves and lava lizards. This island boasts one of the most attractive coves in the whole archipelago. Take a hike along the coast into the opuntia forest, then cool off with a snorkel, looking out for schools of fish, rays and sea turtles. After, continue to Isla Plaza Sur. When you arrive on this small, gorgeous island, you’ll head out for another walk to get close to sea lions, passing one of the Galapagos’ largest land iguana populations on the way. The southern cliffs are great for spotting tropicbirds and swallow-tailed gulls, as well as ‘the Gentlemen’s Club’ – a gathering of male sea lions. Today, there may be an extra stop on the way to Plaza Sur to restock the boat’s provisions. Day - 4 Location: Isla Genovesa - Explore Isla Genovesa – the archipelago's north-eastern outpost. The island’s varied landscapes are a twitcher's paradise, with all three kinds of boobies (including the rare red-footed booby) nesting here. Next, see Bahia Darwin (Darwin Beach) for another birding site with large breeding colonies of seabirds, frigates, lava herons, swallow-tailed gulls, mockingbirds and vampire finches. Head out for a hike to see tide pools, sea lions and diamond stingrays. The steep Prince Philip's Steps lead you to the heart of the seabird rookeries, with birds swirling overhead and nesting among the cliffs. Look out for storm petrels on the island’s rocky plains – Genovesa is the only place in the world where these birds can be seen flying during the day! After, maybe cool off with a snorkel, looking out for manta rays, sharks, turtles and moray eels, plus many species of fish. Day - 5 Location: Isla Santiago/Isla Santa Cruz - On Santiago Island's eastern coast sits Bahia Sullivan. Take a walk along pahoehoe lava, which was created by an eruption that occurred here in 1897. With some luck, you might see some marine iguanas, Sally Lightfoot crabs, sea lions, finches, turtles, sharks and penguins. During your walk, as always, your naturalist guide will take you through the geological history of the island. Then, travel to Cerro Dragon (Dragon Hill) – one of the best places to see land iguanas. Walk to a brackish lagoon to see lagoon birds such as stilts, pintail ducks, sandpipers, sanderlings and flamingos. Further inland, the trail offers a beautiful view of the bay and the western area of the archipelago. This area is a nesting site for land iguanas, which is constantly monitored and assisted by the Charles Darwin Research Station. The arid-zone vegetation makes for an ideal place to see Darwin's finches, Galapagos mockingbirds, the endemic Galapagos flycatcher and yellow warblers. Day - 6 Location: Isla Santa Cruz/Quito - Explore the red mangrove wetland of Caleta Tortuga Negra (Black Turtle Cove) today on your Zodiac. Cruise through this peaceful cove and look out for mating green turtles, golden cow-nose rays, eagle rays and Galapagos sharks. After, head to the airport in Isla Baltra for your flight back to Quito. You’ll arrive back in Quito at approximately 4 pm, where you’ll then transfer to your hotel for your last night.
