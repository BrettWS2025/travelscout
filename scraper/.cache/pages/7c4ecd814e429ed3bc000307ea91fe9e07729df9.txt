Chatham Island is New Zealand’s easternmost outpost, the first permanently inhabited place in the world to welcome the new day. The isolation of the Chathams has created a unique island lifestyle and society, and many locals descend from Moriori genealogy. Spend your time exploring the sights of Chatham Island with a group of fellow travellers, through unforgettable activities – from scenic reserves and dramatic coastal landscapes to historic sites that tell the stories of generations past. At various points throughout the tour, you’ll be joined by local guides who share their insight into the island’s rich history, culture, and landscapes. Discover the rich Moriori history and culture during your stay, along with the Māori and European history. The remote location of Chatham Island means there is endemic flora and fauna, found nowhere else in the world.
