This ancient marvel was dug into the hard rock slopes of Mount Tauro in the 3rd-century BC, with seating to accommodate thousands of spectators. The Teatro Antico di Taormina was built in the Greek tradition of incorporating the natural surroundings to become part of the performance, with light and air permeating the columns to become part of the story.
