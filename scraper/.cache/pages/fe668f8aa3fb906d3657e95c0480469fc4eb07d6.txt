Kicking off in Nashville with a singalong or two, this trip takes you from the home of Elvis to the home of NASA – with the unmissable vibes of New Orleans in between. Learning about civil rights, the Space Race and much more, you’ll be utterly flawed by the majestic culture, scenery and seriously good steakhouses.

Our trip begins here in Nashville - the home of all things country. (Don't worry though, we won't be workin' nine til five here.) After joining your Contiki crew at the hotel, we'll spend the evening hanging out - ready to hit the road in the morning. Day 2 - Nashville Today is yours to explore Nashville. Truly a musical paradise, a tour around the Country Music Hall of Fame will give us the lowdown on this city's musical past. Day 3 - Nashville to Memphis Sorry Nash, but we gotta dash. Next up, it's the home of the King himself... Welcome to Memphis. Here you'll have a free afternoon to explore, but we have plenty of optional activities for you to choose from. Memphis is the home of Elvis Presley, and you'll have the chance to visit Graceland (his former home) and Sun Studios (where he recorded many of his albums). Also in Memphis is the Civil Rights Museum, where you'll have the chance to pay tribute to Martin Luther King Jr, a vital force during the civil rights movement. Day 4 - Memphis to New Orleans Speaking of 'a little more action', it's time for us to head to our next destination - New Orleans. The love-child of French &amp; Caribbean culture, New Orleans will steal our hearts as soon as we arrive. We'll check out the French quarter and jam in Jackson Square before sampling beignets &amp; marveling at elegant, pre-war mansions, all to the sweet sounds of Southern jazz, of course. Day 5 - New Orleans New Orleans, baby... You have the whole of today to soak up the sounds, smells and songs of a truly soulful city. How about an airboat swamp tour out on the Mississippi? Day 6 - New Orleans to Houston Bidding farewell to New Orleans, it's time to make our way to Texas' largest city, Houston. With huge belt buckles &amp; portion sizes to match, Houston city certainly lives up to its larger-than-life reputation. We can't leave Houston without visiting the NASA Space Centre, can we? So that's exactly what we'll do. Day 7 - Houston to Dallas/Fort Worth Houston, we have a... great day ahead of us today. We'll hit the road once again, this time with Dallas in our sights. Welcome to Dallas! We'll visit the historic stockyards, chill with the cattle and tuck into a BBQ dinner too. And of course, get a load of that sizzling sunset. Then it's back to our hotel in Fort Worth (right on the outskirts of Dallas). Day 8 - Dallas/Forth Worth Today you're mostly free to explore Dallas however you like, but first, your Trip Manager will take you on an orientation tour, which includes the Dealey Plaza, The Arts District and the Dallas Reunion Tower. Day 9 - End Dallas/Fort Worth And it's here in Dallas that our USA adventure comes to an end. We've laughed, we've been amazed, we've sang along to more Dolly Parton hits than we thought possible. Now it's time to start dreaming about the next one. More Deals Enquire *Terms and Conditions Offer subject to availability at time of booking.
