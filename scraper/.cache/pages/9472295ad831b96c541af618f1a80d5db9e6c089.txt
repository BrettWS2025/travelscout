There’s ample time to chat with the skipper in the wheelhouse to learn about PS Australian Star, and her river history or simply relax in your private cabin.

Listen to the river birds’ evening chorus and watch for kangaroos, wombats, and many species of birds as the stars begin to appear. Tonight, we moor at Norris Bend where your crew will have a riverside campfire (weather-dependent) ready for you to enjoy after dinner. Day 2 - Onshore Tour & Perricoota Station After a hearty breakfast, Australian Star cruises to the famous Perricoota Station, the property first settled by James Maiden in 1843, and famous for starring in the TV mini series “All the River Run” where our famous PS Emmylou was renamed PS Providence. Here you will depart to Restdown Winery, producers of fine organic wines and Hereford beef. Join the property’s owners for a guided tour along a 1.4km wetlands walking trail, highlighting items of great Aboriginal significance before a gourmet lunch of local produce and wine tastings. Arriving back at Perricoota Station the skipper will invite you to walk along the historical buildings and immaculate gardens of Perricoota Station before happy hour. Tonight enjoy a fabulous dinner aboard overlooking the famous Perricoota Station mansion. Tonight, after dinner it’s Movie Night with a special presentation of “Riverboats Remembered”, a fabulous historical presentation featuring archival footage of the paddle steamers and communities of the Murray River from the early 1900s through to the mid1970s. Day 3 - All Day Cruising & Layfield Lane For early risers and keen photographers, the morning mist and wildlife around Perricoota is a sight to behold. After breakfast, Australian Star gracefully steams onwards upstream for a full day of cruising towards our riverside mooring, Layfield Lane mooring. Today enjoy lunch on the deck or in the saloon with plenty of time to relax with a good book or just take in the river views. Tonight, enjoy a grand dinner on the riverbank – our signature Australian BBQ (weather dependent), lit up by candles on the tables and stars in the sky. After dinner enjoy casual conversation around the campfire (weather dependent) with live entertainment before retiring for the evening.

Next, prepare to be enchanted by our 110-year-old PS Canberra featuring a red gum timber hull built in 1912 at Goolwa South Australia. Enjoy morning tea aboard. Before returning to Australian Star for lunch when your river cruise adventure continues upstream cruising past the imposing Port of Echuca Wharf once home to over 100 paddlesteamers in its heyday.
