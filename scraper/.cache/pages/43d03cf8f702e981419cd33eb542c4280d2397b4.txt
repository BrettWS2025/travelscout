Once settled into your hotel, perhaps start exploring the city via the 1.25-mile Riverwalk along the Chicago River or do some shopping at the many well-known stores along Michigan Avenue, better known as the Magnificent Mile. Day 2 Chicago Chicago is known for its iconic architecture, world class museums, and beautiful waterfront. Sightseeing includes landmarks like the Wrigley Building, Willis Tower (formerly the Sears Tower), and Navy Pier followed by an afternoon at leisure. Consider a visit to the extraordinary Art Institute of Chicago or enjoy an optional river cruise to take in the Windy City’s amazing architecture. Then perhaps go for a slice (or three) of iconic Chicago deep-dish pizza! Day 3 Chicago - St. Louis Travel across the fertile Illinois farmlands to St. Louis, “Gateway to the West.” An orientation tour includes Gateway Arch National Park, which commemorates the city’s key role in westward expansion and a visit to the museum under the Arch, which celebrates Lewis & Clark’s famous expedition 200 years ago. Day 4 St. Louis - Paducah - Nashville Recross the Mississippi River and roll southeast to Paducah, Kentucky on the Ohio River. Have time for lunch there and perhaps pay a visit to the National Quilt Museum to view quilts that truly are works of art. Late afternoon arrival in Nashville. Day 5 Nashville Take a sightseeing tour of Nashville, the Country Music Capital of the World and visit the famous landmarks like Centennial Park with its reproduction of the Parthenon and see the recording studios on Music Row. Consider joining an optional excursion to tour both historic RCA Studio B, birthplace of the 1960s “Nashville Sound” where stars such as Dolly Parton, Elvis Presley, Willie Nelson, and the Everly Brothers recorded many of their biggest hits and the Country Music Hall of Fame to see glittering costumes, rare instruments, and Elvis Presley’s “solid gold” Cadillac. Tonight, enjoy reserved seating for a toe-tapping show at the world-famous Grand Ole Opry, a mecca for country musicians. Day 6 Nashville - Brownsville - Memphis Depart Nashville and visit the Tina Turner Museum in the one-room schoolhouse attended by a young Anna Mae Bullock (a.k.a. Tina Turner). See the collection of the “Queen of Rock’s” memorabilia, including costumes, gold records, and even her high school yearbook! Arrive in Memphis, “Home of the Blues” and a city with a distinct Southern flavour. Enjoy an orientation tour on arrival featuring Beale Street and the Lorraine Hotel where Martin Luther King was assassinated. Later, consider an optional excursion to Sun Studio where Elvis first recorded, as well as other music legends like B.B. King, Johnny Cash and Jerry Lee Lewis, followed by dinner. Day 7 Memphis - Visit to Graceland Enjoy time today at Graceland, Elvis Presley’s beautiful estate. Your guided audio tour focuses on the opulent 15,000-square-foot mansion and the Meditation Garden where Elvis, and his daughter and grandson, are laid to rest. Go inside Elvis’ custom jets and see his favourite automobiles. Return to Memphis mid-afternoon and, if you haven’t done so already, perhaps get a real taste of Memphis with some southern barbecue and live music on Beale Street. Day 8 Memphis - Indianola - New Orleas Today, make your way through the state of Mississippi to Indianola, birthplace of B.B. (Blues Boy) King. There, you’ll visit the B.B. King Museum and Delta Interpretive Center that tells his life story, from his humble beginnings to his big break on Beale Street and also learn about the impact the Mississippi Delta had on the birth of American Music. Early this evening, arrive in New Orleans with time to start exploring the ‘Big Easy’ on your own. Day 9 New Orleans A full morning is dedicated to the sights and sounds of New Orleans, featuring a guided tour that includes the French Quarter landmarks, St. Louis Cathedral and Jackson Square, and a visit to a unique above-ground cemetery. This afternoon, continue exploring this lively city on your own or join an optional excursion to tour one of the many plantation homes in southern Louisiana. The architecture and beauty of these homes alone is impressive and the stories that go with them are even better. Or cruise down bayous with moss-draped cypress trees to seek out alligators on an optional Louisiana Swamp Tour. This evening, enjoy an optional Mississippi River dinner cruise, complete with live jazz—the perfect finale to a memorable touring adventure of the South. Day 10 New Orleans Your holiday ends this morning. You may choose to extend your holiday with extra nights and explore the “Big Easy” further.
