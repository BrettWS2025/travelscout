Enjoy the rest of the day at your leisure. Day 2: Delhi (B) This morning, embark on a journey through Old Delhi, navigating its labyrinthine alleys, side streets, and iconic bazaars. Enjoy a rickshaw ride past the impressive Red Fort, a masterpiece in red sandstone, and glimpse the grandeur of Jama Masjid, India's largest mosque (viewed from outside). Wander through the bustling lanes and vibrant markets of Chandni Chowk, soaking in the atmosphere of this oriental bazaar. Next, explore New Delhi, renowned for its colonial-era architecture and wide boulevards. Visit the 12th-century Qutab Minar, renowned for its intricate hand-carved designs across its entire 234-foot height. Discover the mausoleum of Emperor Humayun, a precursor to Mughal architectural style, and visit the imposing modern Lakshminarayan Temple. Conclude the day with a visit to Raj Ghat, an open-air memorial dedicated to Mahatma Gandhi. Overnight in Delhi. Day 3: Delhi to Agra (B) This morning, transfer to the railway station for the high-speed train journey to Agra. Upon arrival in Agra, visit Itimad-ud-Daulah, an exquisite mausoleum situated on the banks of the Yamuna River, often referred to as the “Little Taj”. Proceed to Agra Fort, a monumental structure built alongside the Yamuna River, stretching nearly 2.5 km. The fort's massive double walls rise 20 meters high and span a circumference of 2.5 km. Its impressive towers, bastions, ramparts, and grand gateways reflect the authority and grandeur of the third Mughal emperor. Transfer to your hotel for the night, the Oberoi Amarvilas, where you can unwind in the lounge and enjoy a stunning view of the Taj Mahal. Day 4: Agra to Jaipur (B) At sunrise, begin your day with a visit to the Taj Mahal, an exquisite white marble monument constructed by Shah Jahan in memory of his beloved wife. Known as the "Crown Palace," the Taj Mahal is renowned as one of the world's most well-preserved and architecturally stunning tombs. English poet Sir Edwin Arnold described it as "Not a piece of architecture, as other buildings are, but the proud passions of an emperor’s love wrought in living stones." It stands as a magnificent tribute to womanhood, crafted entirely in marble, offering a truly remarkable sight. Later, continue your journey to Jaipur, with a stop en-route at Fatehpur Sikri. Built by Emperor Akbar in 1569 and abandoned after 15 years due to water scarcity, Fatehpur Sikri houses remarkably well-preserved and elegant structures within its 'Ghost City'. Highlights include the Jama Masjid, the tomb of Salim Chisti, the Panch Mahal Palace, and other palaces that reflect the grandeur and opulence of the Mughal Empire at its zenith. Continue onward to Jaipur, where you will stay for two nights. Day 5: Jaipur (B,D) Jaipur, known as the “Pink City” was meticulously planned and constructed in the 18th century by Maharaja Jai Singh II. Designed as the colonial capital of a vibrant and colourful state, it received its distinctive pink hue in 1853 as a gesture of welcome during the visit of Prince Albert. Begin your exploration with a visit to the City Palace, centrally located in Jaipur. This sprawling complex now serves as both a royal residence and a museum, showcasing a rich array of textiles, costumes, armoury, manuscripts, and paintings. Adjacent to the palace is the Jantar Mantar observatory, built by the astute astronomer King Jai Singh II. The instruments, crafted from stone and adorned with marble, are positioned strategically to measure celestial harmonies. Each device fulfills a specific purpose and provides precise astronomical readings. Continue your journey with a visit to the Amber Fort, situated 11 km north of Jaipur atop a hill. This majestic fort served as the Rajput dynasty's ancient capital from the 11th to the 18th century and is renowned more for its palace-like architecture than its defensive structures. The fort boasts a unique blend of Hindu and Muslim architectural styles and offers leisure time to explore Jaipur's vibrant markets. In the evening, immerse yourself in a cultural experience with a local Indian family. Participate in an interactive cooking session, followed by a delicious dinner paired with local beer. Learn the art of tying a traditional sari and enjoy lively Bollywood music, gaining insights into the warmth and hospitality of Indian culture. Day 6: Jaipur to Nimaj (B) Today, embark on a scenic drive to the Chhatrasagar Luxury Camp in Nimaj, where you will be hosted for the next two nights. This serene retreat features 11 luxurious and elegantly appointed tents situated on a dam, offering breathtaking views of a lake bustling with birdlife. Upon arrival, you will receive a warm welcome from the Rathore family, who have owned this land for 17 generations and are descendants of the Maharajah of Jodhpur. Day 7: Nimaj (B) Take a day to unwind and indulge in delightful home-cooked meals. You have the option to join a farm and village excursion or embark on a bird-watching tour by Jeep ride through the nearby village. Enjoy the tranquility and natural beauty of the surroundings at your leisure. Day 8: Nimaj to Jodhpur (B) Morning drive to Jodhpur, situated on the edge of the Thar Desert, the second largest city in Rajasthan after Jaipur. This ancient settlement, over five hundred years old, was the hub of Rathore Rajputs, renowned for their tales of valour. Jodhpur is famed for its formidable, fortified bastions, particularly Mehrangarh Fort, which has witnessed numerous battles and holds deep historical significance for the region. The subsequent era of peace led to the construction of palaces sprawled across expansive grounds, reflecting an elaborate European influence. Explore the magnificent Mehrangarh Fort, established by Rao Jodha in 1459 on a sandstone hill. From its lofty vantage point, enjoy panoramic views of the old city, where the predominant blue houses, known as Brahmin houses, symbolize the high caste. Visit Jaswant Thada next, an imposing marble cenotaph erected in 1899 for Maharajah Jaswant Singh II, featuring smaller memorials to other Maharajahs of Jodhpur. Conclude your tour with a vintage car ride in Jodhpur. Your accommodation will be at either Raas Jodhpur or Umaid Bhawan Palace, depending on your chosen package, with Umaid Bhawan Palace being one of the largest and most luxurious residences globally. Day 9: Jodhpur to Udaipur (B) Depart from Jodhpur for Udaipur. Along the way, stop to explore the renowned Jain temples of Ranakpur, renowned for their exquisite sculptures. Afterward, proceed to your hotel in Udaipur, where you will stay for the next two nights based on your selected accommodation package. You can choose between Rass Devigarh or Taj Lake Palace, a stunning marble palace seemingly floating on the serene blue waters of Lake Pichola. Day 10: Udaipur (B) Udaipur is nestled in the Girwa Valley amidst the Aravali hills of southern Rajasthan, celebrated as a city of romance with its lakes, gardens, temples, and palaces—a veritable oasis in the Thar Desert. The old city is a meticulously planned fortified enclave, characterized by a labyrinth of narrow winding lanes lined with houses adorned with Mewar folk art doorways, windows adorned with stained glass or lattice screens, grand havelis with expansive inner courtyards, and bustling shops. Begin your exploration with a visit to the City Palace, once the royal residence of Mewar’s rulers and now predominantly a museum administered by the Maharana Mewar Foundation. It comprises four major palaces and several smaller ones, all forming an impressive facade overlooking Lake Pichola. Next, visit the Jagdish Temple and explore the vibrant local market. In the evening, enjoy a romantic boat ride on Lake Pichola. Overnight in Udaipur.
