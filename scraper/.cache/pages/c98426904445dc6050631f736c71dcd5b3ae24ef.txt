Lifou is east of the little nation's mainland and is the largest of New Caledonia's four Loyalty Islands. Around its coast are high cliffs, white-sand beaches and coral reefs. The rich vegetation of the interior supports a wealth of vivid birds, from red and black New Caledonian myzomelas to yellow and grey fantailed gerygones. In addition, the island is dotted with vanilla plantations. Cruise ships call in at Easo in the north-west, anchoring just off land, with tenders taking passengers ashore; beaches stretch either side of the dock. An old missionary chapel, Notre Dame de Lourdes, is strikingly set on cliffs above the bay and can be reached on foot.
