Meet your private Egyptologist guide who will unlock the secrets of the ancient capital on this full day tour. Begin your day with a visit to the impressive site of the Pyramids whose construction began in 2690 BC. The Pyramids of Mycerinus, Chefren and the Great Pyramid of Cheops are the only survivors from the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. Face the mystical Sphinx, reputedly used as target practice by Napoleon’s troops. Optional (supplement applies): Take a Camel Ride across the sands of the desert with the Pyramids in the background After regathering your thoughts travel with your driver cross country to the ancient capital of Memphis, then continue to visit the original pyramids at Sakkara – the oldest surviving Egyptian pyramid. This most ancient of pyramids was the first to be built in ancient Egypt, preceding those at Giza by many centuries. Essentially a sequence of decreasingly sized mastaba placed atop each other, this architectural advance of raising tombs closer to the heavens ultimately led to the creation of the Great Pyramids of Giza. Optional Tour (supplement applies): Top off an unforgettable day with an incredible evening attending the Sound and Light Show at the Pyramids Day 3: Cairo - Luxor (B) From the oldest buildings in Egypt to one of the newest. Embark on a captivating visit with your private Egyptologist-Guide to the Grand Egyptian Museum (GEM), one of the largest and most comprehensive archaeological museums in the world located near the Pyramids. Spanning over 5,000 years of history, this museum boasts an extraordinary collection of artifacts that trace the rich cultural heritage of Egypt inspired by the boy King Tutankhamun. Currently in its "second soft-opening phase," the GEM has unveiled 12 of its main galleries, offering a glimpse into its vast treasures. As you step inside, you’ll be welcomed by the imposing figure of Ramses II, a colossal statue that has been relocated from Tahrir Square and now stands proudly in the museum’s grand foyer. From here, you'll journey through the newly opened galleries, where over 15,000 meticulously curated artifacts are displayed. These exhibits span millennia, showcasing the incredible achievements of ancient Egyptian civilization, from its earliest dynasties to the grandeur of its later empires. With each step, you'll delve deeper into the stories of pharaohs, gods, and everyday life, uncovering the mysteries and marvels of one of the world's oldest and most influential cultures. (The GEM also has a shopping complex and cafes). Upon completion of the tour, you will be transferred to Cairo Airport for your flight to Luxor. On arrival in Luxor, you will be transferred by private vehicle to your hotel where accommodation has been reserved for two nights. Day 4: Luxor (B) This morning you will be met by your private Egyptologist-guide then head out to discover the Temple of Medinat Habu which is the Mortuary Temple of Ramses III. Continue to the house of famed archaeologist Howard Carter. Neglected for a long time, the house has been restored to its former state under the guidance of the famous Egyptologist and Archaeologist Dr Zahi Hawass. It is a fascinating insight into the life of the man who discovered the tomb of Tutankhamun after years of searching the Valley of the Kings. In the afternoon, return to the East Bank and visit the Mummification Museum. The ancient Egyptians believed that for a person to reach the afterlife, it was essential that both their body and their name remained, so their Soul would be transported from one life to the next. To achieve this the mummification rituals were developed to preserve the body. The museum contains several human and animal mummies as well as the tools and the canopic jars needed for the ritual. Evening at leisure or to explore the markets of Luxor. Overnight Luxor. Day 5: Luxor - embark Nile Cruise (BLD) Leisurely morning before embarking on your Nile Cruise. After lunch on board your cruise ship you will head out to explore one of the world’s most remarkable open-air museums - Thebes. Visit the magnificent Luxor Temple then follow the Avenue of the Sphinx to the Temple complex of Karnak. This gigantic site was added to by approximately 30 different Pharaohs over time, which goes some way to explaining its immense size and majestic grandeur. Dinner on board. Overnight Luxor. Day 6: Luxor - Esna (BLD) Early this morning you will embark on a journey across the Nile to the West Bank, where a morning filled with remarkable sights awaits.

Following breakfast on board you will set out to view remains dating back to the Old Kingdom, as well as the revered Temple of Horus – one of the holiest of the Egyptian pantheon of gods. Return to the ship mid-morning and continue sailing to Kom Ombo. Spend time relaxing onboard the ship prior to a late afternoon visit to the Kom Ombo Temple. This remarkable temple was jointly shared by the two Gods: Sobek, depicted with the head of a crocodile, and Horus, represented with the head of a falcon. It was constructed during the Ptolemaic period, spanning from 237 to 57 BCE. Admire the beautifully preserved murals and intricate bas-relief, adorned with inscriptions that offer valuable insights into language, mythology, and religion during the Egypt's Greco-Roman era. There will be a Galabeya party on board this evening. Day 8: Aswan (BLD) Early this morning your ship will set sail for Aswan. After breakfast visit the High Dam, the Granite Quarries and the beautifully restored Temple of Philae, dedicated to the goddess Isis (the mother of Horus).
