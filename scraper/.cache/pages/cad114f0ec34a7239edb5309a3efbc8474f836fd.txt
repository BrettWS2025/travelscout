Kilimanjaro was once part of Kenya, but on the marriage of Kaiser Wilhelm of Germany, Queen Victoria gifted it to her beloved grandson, whose colony Tanzania then was, as the perfect wedding present. The mountain now provides water for the park, wonderful views and, of course, the most glorious background for animal photography.

A visit to the crater is a main draw card for safari-goers in Tanzania and is a world-class attraction. The Ngorongoro Conservation Area (NCA) is home of Ngorongoro Crater which was formed some 2.5 million years ago from a volcanic mountain sinking due to inactivity. The mountain is thought to have been higher than Mount Kilimanjaro. The crater has evolved into a unique and integral part of Tanzania’s eco-system. The crater is a caldera measuring 22.5 km across, with 600m hight rim walls. Views from within and from the rim are breathtaking. The crater houses 30,000 animals and a large variety of birds, which rarely move from the area due to the availability of water through wet and dry seasons. Day 14 : Karatu to Arusha to Kilimanjaro Breakfast at the lodge. Drive to Arusha and onward to Kilimanjaro International Airport for your onward flight.
