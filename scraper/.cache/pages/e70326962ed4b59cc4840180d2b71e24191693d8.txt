Discover the lagoons that are havens for waterbirds, learn about the site of a World War II Japanese internment camp and cross creeks that feed the red gum forests and box woodlands. A gentle climb through the cliffs reveals a magnificent view of the vast Murray River floodplain that will surround you over the next 3 days. A short transfer across the river in the cruiser and you have arrived at your destination. Your “Boat Guide” will welcome you aboard and settle you in – before a cool foot dip in the river or a hot spa followed by a 3-course dinner paired with local wines. Day 2: Heading Cliffs to Chowilla Creek Rise before the sun and walk a gentle slope to the rim of the Murray River valley for a spectacular sunrise. Watch the vibrant colours of the cliffs come to life and marvel at the walking route below before returning to the houseboat for a cooked breakfast. Depart again for the daily walk discovering Aboriginal canoe trees, giant red gum forests and small islands along leafy Amazon Creek. Arriving at your floating home you’ll enjoy a local tasting plate as you dip your feet in the cool waters of the Murray River. Day 3: Chowilla Creek to Bunyip Reach Cliffs Awake to the mists on the water and enjoy a great coffee, local navel oranges and tasty breakfast followed by a briefing on the Murray Darling Basin and the management of its vast network of rivers which drain 14% of Australia. Today we cruise to the Chowilla Creek Environmental Regulator to learn about environmental watering and new stewardship for the river, before setting off on our walk. You’ll walk along Chowilla Creek, restored wetlands and visit the proposed site of the 1960s Chowilla Dam. In the afternoon we celebrate completing our walking journey on Queens Bend Cliffs before cruising to the houseboat as the late afternoon sun illuminates the red cliffs. A campfire awaits before dinner. Day 4: Bunyip Reach Cliffs to Wilkadene Woolshed Brewery After breakfast take a self-guided 2 km walk along the river, before cruising in the pontoon boat through Lock 6. Experience a gentle drop in the water level of 3 metres. Rejoining the houseboat downstream, we cruise for 2 hours on the houseboat to the innovative Wilkadene Woolshed Brewery, set in a 100 year old shearing shed on the banks of the river.Enjoy a tour with the head brewer before sitting down with our guides to a fine barbecue, before saying our farewells. You will depart for Renmark by bus and arrive at the Renmark Hotel at 2.00 pm.
