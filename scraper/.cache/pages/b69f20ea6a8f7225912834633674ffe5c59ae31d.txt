Or Rubibi, in the language of the Yawuru people, who are the Traditional Owners of the land on which Broome is now located. Start your adventure straight away, setting off early this morning, and travel through the remote and beautiful Kimberley landscape. After crossing the Fitzroy River, visit the Boab Prison Tree in Derby. Then, wander around an art gallery before continuing along the Gibb River Road to Tunnel Creek. When you arrive, explore this 750 m long cave system carved through the Napier Range. As you walk, look out for the stalactites and a large variety of wildlife like bats and freshwater crocodiles, and hear the legend of Jandamarra – an Aboriginal freedom fighter who used the tunnel as a hide out in the late 1800's. Tonight, settle into camp near Windjana Gorge and watch as the stars come alive, away from the city lights. Day 2 West Kimberley Gorges The Napier Range is over 350 million years old and is home to the geological wonder of Windjana Gorge. Spend this morning walking beneath the gorge walls, looking for freshwater crocodiles, local birdlife and indigenous bush tucker. This afternoon, you’ll travel to Bell Gorge (Dalmanyi). This landmark in the West Kimberleys is known for its cascading waterfalls and clear pools formed millions of years ago. When you arrive, set off on the Bell Gorge Trail to Dalmanyi Falls. When you reach the end of the trail, stop and explore the area from the top of the falls or maybe continue along the Falls Trail, taking you through the creek above the falls. Day 3 West Kimberley Gorges Travel to Manning Gorge, where you'll hike the Manning Falls Trail. Starting with a river crossing, follow the trail along the Manning River to the falls. When you arrive, cool off in the deep clear pool or maybe climb to the top of the waterfall for panoramic views over the Mount Barnett Station. This afternoon, visit the Galvans Gorge. After a short bushwalk, dive into the cool waters of the gorge and sit underneath the falls for a natural back massage. Then, take some time exploring the rock walls beside the main pool, where you’ll find Wandjina rock art, before heading back to camp for the night. Day 4 Gibb River Road to El Questro Wilderness Park Today is a driving day, so sit back, relax and enjoy the Kimberley scenery and the famous ‘Gibb River Road massage’ provided by the rugged dirt track you'll be driving on. Today is a bit of a long travel day, so it's a good idea to get stuck into your book or favourite podcast. Along the way, you’ll stop off at the Pentecost River Lookout that takes in the river floodplain and the tabletop Cockburn Ranges. Tonight, settle into camp at El Questro and enjoy a relaxing night by the campfire. Day 5 El Questro Wilderness Park After breakfast, set off on the Emma Gorge Trail, known for its towering 120 m cliff face made of Cockburn and quartz sandstone. As you walk along the crystal-clear pools and waterfalls, look out for ripple markings in the rocks formed under shallow tidal waters millions of years ago. Then, take a short walk through the forest of Livistona and pandanus palms to the Zebedee Springs. When you arrive, spend some time exploring the natural thermal rock pools at the base of the cliff and cool off with a dip in the water. This afternoon is free for you to spend how you like. Maybe cruise on the Chamberlain Gorge, join a bush tucker walk or bird watching tour or simply explore this wilderness park at your pace. Tonight, maybe head out for a pub-style dinner at the restaurant on El Questro Station. Day 6 Kununurra to Lake Argyle This morning, drive to Kununurra, where you have some free time to wander the shops and galleries in the main area or find a local cafe for a coffee. Then, time permitting, you'll have the option to visit the Hoochery (a local distillery known for its rum) or the Zebra Rock Gallery (a gallery showcasing crafted ornaments made from Zebra Rock found in the region) with your leader. This afternoon, travel to the shores of the expansive Lake Argyle – the heart of the Ord River Irrigation System which has transformed this dry region into an agricultural oasis. Spend some time exploring the area and maybe dive into the infinity pool at Lake Argyle camp. Day 7 Lake Argyle Today is a free day for you to explore Lake Argyle at your own pace. Maybe visit the Durack Homestead Museum, set off on one of the many bush trails or join a sunset boat cruise on the lake (highly recommended). Tonight, maybe sit down for dinner at the holiday park’s restaurant. Day 8 Purnululu National Park (Bungle Bungles) After a leisurely morning, head down the Great Northern Highway to Purnululu National Park, home of the magnificent Bungle Bungles. This UNESCO World Heritage site is known for its landscape of unique orange and black striped ‘beehive’ geological formations, created by rivers over a period of 20 million years. When you arrive, take some time to settle into your private permanent tented camp and take in the views of the Bungles Massif and the Kimberley night sky from your door. Day 9 Purnululu National Park (Bungle Bungles) Spend the morning exploring the Echidna Chasm, known for its towering Livistonia Palm trees. Set off on the Echidna Chasm Walk, following the steep-sided gorge walls with shades of oranges and reds that glow when the sun hits them. Take in the panoramic views over the Osmand Range before continuing to the Cathedral Gorge. Known for its towering rocks, which create a natural amphitheatre due to its acoustics, spend the afternoon walking the Cathedral Gorge Trail. Later today, maybe take an optional scenic helicopter flight for a bird-eye view over the beehive domes. Day 10 China Wall to Fitzroy Crossing This morning, travel to Fitzroy Crossing. Named due to the Martuwarra (Fitzroy River) that runs through it, the Fitzroy Valley is home to more than 40 Aboriginal communities, combining five different language groups – Bunuba, Gooniyandi, Nyikina, Wangkatjunka and Walmajarri. On the way, stop at the China Wall near Halls Creek – a natural white limestone wall which looks like a miniature Great Wall of China. If there’s time, make another stop at Mary’s Pool for lunch before continuing to Fitzroy Crossing. The rest of the evening is free for you to explore the area before settling into camp by the Fitzroy River. Day 11 Fitzroy Crossing to Broome This morning, join the Darlgunya Cultural Walk, where your local indigenous guide will take you through the remnants of the old postal settlement and down to the Fitzroy Riverbanks. Learn about the wild Fitzroy River – about its plants, wildlife and the significance to the local culture. Enjoy lunch on the way, before returning to Broome this afternoon. When you arrive in Broome, your trip will come to an end. If you’d like to stay longer, just talk to your booking agent ahead of time. Don't miss out! This value-packed tour deal is ending very soon.
