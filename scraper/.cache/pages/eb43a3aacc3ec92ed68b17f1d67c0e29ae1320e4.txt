Begin in the bustle of Istanbul learning the traditional art of marbling, then venture underground exploring caverns in Cappadocia. See the ancient wonders of Pamukkale and set sail along the Mediterranean coastline on a relaxing boat trip. There's many magical moments to share with the family on this 10 day trip of Turkey's highlights. Itinerary Day 1: Istanbul Hos geldin! Welcome to Turkey. This family adventure kicks off in Istanbul – the continent-straddling metropolis that the Greeks, Romans, Byzantines and Ottomans have all called home – with a welcome meeting at 1 pm. After, you’ll head out to explore the streets on an orientation tour of the city with your leader. After, maybe head out of dinner and get to know your fellow travellers. Day 2: Cappadocia This morning you'll visit a nearby neighbourhood to take part in an Ebru marbling workshop – a unique artform that uses traditional materials like earth dyes, horsehair and rose branch brushes. As the kids get their hands dirty, you’ll learn about the history and art of marbling from a local instructor, along with the correct way to hold the brush. You can even throw the paint to achieve the best results! You'll have the opportunity to make your very own masterpiece, then after the class, head to the airport for a short flight to Cappadocia. When you arrive, check-in to your accommodation and enjoy a free evening to explore the fairytale city. Day 3: Cappadocia Photographs of hot air balloons soaring over strange rock formations are what most people associate with the Cappadocia region. While this activity is not included, it’s highly recommended. Those who choose to fly this morning will have the unique experience of seeing Cappadocia from above and below. Later this morning, you’ll take an underground city tour. Explore the caverns and tunnels of Kaymakli Underground City – built during between the 9th and 10th centuries as a defensive mechanism. Later, head to the surface and enjoy some free time to further explore the region's valleys or simply relax by the pool. Tonight, visit a local family home to take part in a mini cooking class, using fresh organic produce from the garden, then tuck into a delicious home cooked dinner. Day 4: Konya - Overnight train Enjoy a last morning in Cappadocia before hopping on a private bus to Konya. A city where religion and conservative traditions combine with the modern and cosmopolitan, providing the perfect opportunity to experience Turkish culture unspoiled by mainstream tourism. When you arrive, your leader will take you on a walk around the town to see a few of the sights and allow you the opportunity to grab something to eat before boarding the overnight train in the early evening. Day 5: Selcuk Arrive in Izmir at around 7 am and transfer by private minivan for the drive to Selcuk. Have some breakfast and then you’ll have free time to soak in the culture of this fascinating city. This afternoon, head out on an orientation walk around the city to get your bearings. You may like to spend the afternoon relaxing around the hotel's swimming pool while the kids go for a swim or maybe just go exploring at your own pace. A short distance out of Selcuk is one of the Seven Wonders of the ancient world – the Temple of Artemis – although, sadly, only a single column (of 127 originally) remains after it was ultimately destroyed in AD 401. Day 6: Ephesus - Selcuk This morning, you'll head off to explore the nearby ruins of Ephesus – the former capital of the Byzantine Empire and the best-preserved ancient city in Turkey. According to Christian tradition, St John came to Ephesus with the Virgin Mary from Jerusalem and lived here until his death sometime around AD 100, and the basilica stands over his believed burial site. On the slopes of Ayasoluk Hill lie several historic buildings like the imposing Byzantine citadel of the Grand Fortress and the ruins of the Basilica of St John. After spending some time exploring the site, enjoy a delicious local lunch of gozleme before returning to Selcuk to enjoy the rest of the afternoon at leisure. Day 7: Pamukkale - Fethiye Today is a long travel day but with worthy reward as you visit one of Turkey's most photographed sites, Pamukkale. Literally translating to ‘cotton castle,’ you’ll soon understand why as you view the impossibly blue, natural terrace baths, formed by calcium-rich springs and used as spas since 200 BC. Though you’re not allowed to bathe in the travertines, you can walk through them after removing your shoes and see for yourself if the pool's alleged healing properties are real. You'll have some time for lunch, then in the afternoon continue to Fethiye – a port city on Turkey’s stunning turquoise coast, where you’ll spend the next two nights. Day 8: Fethiye Wake up in paradise this morning and get ready to spend a relaxing day sailing and swimming along the Mediterranean coastline with your family. Board your boat and set sail from the bay exploring nearby islands and coves, stopping to swim in the turquoise waters along the way. Enjoy a delicious homemade Turkish lunch onboard prepared by the crew before returning to Fethiye in the afternoon. Later, you might like to wander through the town and have dinner at a nearby restaurant. Day 9: Istanbul This morning, say goodbye to Fethiye and travel to the nearby town of Dalyan. When you arrive, visit Dekamer – a Sea Turtle Rescue and Rehabilitation Center. This organisation rescues and rehabilitates any injured loggerhead turtles (the largest hard-shell turtle in the world) found along the Mediterranean coast of Turkey. You’ll learn all about these turtles and how Dekamer works to protect them and conserve the local environment. You’ll also be directly contributing to rescue and rehabilitation efforts here, as Intrepid contributes a donation to Dekamer for every person on this trip! From here, it's a short drive to Dalaman Airport for your flight back to Istanbul. When you arrive, head out for a final dinner with the other families to celebrate your whirlwind Turkish adventure. Day 10: Istanbul There are no activities planned for the final day, and you can depart the accommodation at any time following check out. If you would like to stay longer in Istanbul, there’s plenty to do with your family. If you need help booking extra accommodation, just reach out to your booking agent ahead of time.
