Deal Details Sale Ends Dec 31, 2025 Priced From $3,765 Enquire Now Four countries, eight national parks, 17 days, hundreds of animals, countless birds and a new group of lifelong friends all make this one unforgettable journey through the best of Southern Africa. Track rhinos at sunset in Zimbabwe, search for wildlife in Kruger National Park, laze in the lagoons of the Okavango Delta in Botswana, and learn about ongoing rhino conservation in Zimbabwe. This overland camping trip brings you everything wild and wonderful about Southern Africa plus a crew of good pals to take it all in with. Itinerary Day 1: Johannesburg Sawubona! Welcome to South Africa. Touch down in Jo’burg (as the locals like to call it) where your adventure begins, ready for your welcome meeting at 6 pm tonight. If you arrive early, maybe visit the Apartheid Museum to start your journey with some local history, crucial in understanding this region. After your meeting, why not head out for a group dinner and get to know your fellow travellers. Your leader can point you in the right direction if you’re looking for local bars and restaurant recommendations. Day 2: Khama Rhino Sanctuary See ya South Africa – this morning, you’ll cross the border into Botswana and travel to the Khama Rhino Sanctuary. It sits on the Kalahari Desert and is an old hunting area transformed into a conservation project. It now protects what’s left of Botswana's black and white rhino populations, but you can also see zebras, giraffes, leopards, ostriches and wildebeest, all of which chill out around the natural waterholes. Not only do you get to check out the animals here, but you’ll also be benefitting local communities and helping protect the white rhino. When the sun begins to set, hop in a jeep to see the rhinos at their most active. About 35 rhinos roam around this 400-hectare community-based reserve, so don’t forget your binoculars! Day 3: Maun Get up nice and early and drive to Maun. When you arrive, you’ll have the chance to stock up on any supplies you might need for the journey ahead. This town is the gateway to one of the world's most renowned and complex ecosystems – the Okavango Delta, a 16,000 square km maze of wetlands made up of waterways, green islands, lush plains and loads of wildlife. You might see hippos, crocodiles, elephants and big cats within the diverse ecosystem here. Tonight, you'll stay on the outskirts of Maun at a simple campsite with shared facilities, wi-fi and optional upgrades. Day 4: Okavango Delta Pan Handle Make your way to the north-western part of the Okavango Delta, close to the Pan Handle. Leave the truck and take a 4WD for the last 12 km to your campsite in the bush. Your accommodation for the next two nights sits on the edge of the Guma Lagoon area and might just be one of the trip’s highlights! When you arrive, set up camp, take in the incredible views of the Delta and relax on the edge of the water for the rest of the afternoon. Tonight, watch as the sunset turns into a brilliant sky full of stars, far away from any light pollution. Then, fall asleep to the sounds of the hippos in the distance. Day 5: Okavango Delta Pan Handle Today, you get to paddle the mighty Delta. There's nothing more relaxing than feeling the African sun on your face as you lie back in a mokoro (traditional dugout canoe), while your expert poler propels you down calm waters through papyrus and reed beds to lily covered lagoons. Watch out for elephants, lechwe, warthogs and sitatunga. Stop at one of the islands for a swim before returning to camp. If you are interested in the culinary side of Southern Africa, feel free to join your cook for a cooking class while they prepare tonight's meal. Day 6: Caprivi Strip This morning, transfer in 4WDs back to the truck and then make your way to the border to cross into Namibia. Your next camp is in the Caprivi Strip – sandwiched between Botswana and Angola, this strip connects with Zambia and Zimbabwe at its end. Take the opportunity to discover your new surroundings on a sunset river cruise, keeping your eyes peeled for hippos and crocodiles. Then, relax at your lodge to the sounds of the bush and look out for some of the 330 species of birds in the area. Day 7: Chobe National Park This morning, zip over to the edge of Chobe National Park, further through the Caprivi Strip and back into Botswana. Botswana's first national park is perhaps best known for its high concentration of elephants, which can often be seen swimming in the Chobe River. The river also attracts wallowing hippos, lots of birdlife, crocodiles sunning themselves and cheetahs and lions venturing out for a drink. When you arrive, kick back at camp with a book and relax. Day 8: Chobe National Park Today, you'll head out on a 4WD game drive in Chobe National Park. There's a huge range of wildlife here, all packed into one tiny area, making it unlike anywhere else in the world! Huge herds of buffalo and elephants are often seen roaming around the savannah, matched by the size of the local lion prides. An estimated 70,000 Kalahari elephants roam the park, too – these amazing beasts are the largest known subspecies of elephant in the world. You might also see zebras, impalas, wildebeest, giraffes, lions, leopards, hyenas, jackals, warthogs, baboons, monkeys and heaps of birds! Day 9: Victoria Falls This morning there will be time to join an optional game drive in Chobe National Park. Then, it’s on to the town of Victoria Falls this afternoon. Cross the border into Zimbabwe and arrive in the early afternoon. Enjoy some free time in Victoria Falls to experience the sights and sounds of the mighty falls. You'll have another meeting at 6 pm tonight to meet the new group members who will joining you on the second half of your adventure. Day 10: Victoria Falls Guess what? You’re at the edge of the greatest curtain of falling water in the world. After a leader-led orientation walk of the town, enjoy a day of free time to take up one of many activities on offer in the area including a gorge swing or white-water rafting! There are many ways to take in the thundering sight and sound of the falls. These staggering cascades are about a mile wide, falling 108 metres into a narrow gorge below. In the wet season, the spray rises high and the falls become a torrent; in the dry season, the lack of spray gives way to a nice view of the islets in the river below. Meet up in the afternoon for a local brewery tour and tasting in town and get to know your new travel pals. Then perhaps kick on with an optional sunset cruise down the Zambezi River . Day 11: Hwange National Park Leave Victoria Falls behind and head to Hwange National Park. En route, stop via the Victoria Falls Wildlife Trust – one of the Intrepid Foundation’s projects - where you can learn about the rescue and rehabilitation of wildlife, human-wildlife conflict and their role in anti-poaching. There may also be a chance to meet any rescued or orphaned wildlife currently in their care. After, explore the stunning arena of Hwange in an open 4x4 vehicle. This national park became the royal hunting grounds of the Ndebele warrior-king Mzilikazi in the early 19th century and was set aside as a national park in 1929. Today, Hwange boasts a massive selection of wildlife, with over 100 species of mammals and nearly 400 bird species. But it's the elephants this place is famous for – here you'll find one of the largest elephant populations in Africa. Day 12: Matobo National Park Make tracks for Matobos with a short detour through Bulawayo, checking out its colonial architecture, before heading to your camp for the next two nights. Home to a large population of black and white rhinoceros that can be tracked on foot, Matobo National Park is also the site of the grave of Cecil John Rhodes, the founder of Rhodesia and the De Beers diamond company. The Matobos area has great spiritual and cultural significance to the local people and there are many sites within the park where important ceremonies still take place. For those interested in the culinary side of southern African food, tonight your cook can provide a cooking class while you help prepare this evening’s delicious meal. Day 13: Matobo National Park Good morning from mighty Matobos. You’re free to do as you please, but what is highly recommended is heading to Matobo Hills and spending the day tracking rhinos and other game animals with the help of your guide on an optional tour. The park is home to so much wildlife, including klipspringers, leopards, warthogs and springhares. Along the way, learn about the flora in the area and find old bushman paintings, see rock formations and learn the history of the area. Then it's off to nearby villages to meet some of the local community. It’s definitely a day you won’t want to miss. Day 14: Tshipise This morning, you will depart Zimbabwe and cross the bustling border post, the only direct crossing between Zimbabwe and South Africa. You’re expected to arrive at your campsite on the edge of Honnet Nature Reserve by late afternoon. Once there, unwind and take advantage of the extensive facilities, including both indoor and outdoor pools, a putt-putt course, a nature trail, and optional game drives. Day 15: Kruger National Park After breakfast, set off for renowned Kruger National Park. This world-famous park is known for Africa's iconic wildlife – lion, elephant, buffalo, leopard and rhino. On top of that, it's home to some 336 kinds of trees, 49 fish species and over 500 species of bird. See how many of these you can spot on your way to your campsite for the night. Day 16: Kruger National Park Today, you will set off on an exhilarating full-day 4WD safari through Kruger National Park. This remarkable reserve, comparable in size to Belgium or Wales, offers an incredible opportunity to witness Africa's iconic animals in their natural habitat, surrounded by breathtaking savannas, lush forests, and expansive landscapes. Kruger is home to a diverse array of wildlife, including elephants, lions, leopards and buffalo, along with the endangered African wild dog. You’ll venture into prime areas for wildlife observation, keeping an eye out for various species ranging from antelopes and springbok to cheetahs and rhinos. Day 17: Johannesburg Venture out this morning for one last safari in your overland truck and soak up all Kruger has to offer. Keep your eyes peeled, ‘cause you never know what will pop out from behind the shrubs! Continue back to Johannesburg, where your trip finishes on arrival at a designated hotel drop-off point.
