This vast UNESCO Biosphere Reserve is the world’s largest tropical wetland and South America's most important wildlife sanctuary. Its rich ecosystem bursts with life, from colourful birds and giant otters to capybaras, anteaters, and the elusive jaguar. At the heart of the Pantanal lies the Caiman Ecological Refuge, a private 53,000-hectare reserve dedicated to conservation and immersive nature experiences. Stay at Casa Caiman Lodge, where conservation is at the heart of the experience and expert guides lead daily safaris by vehicle, canoe or on foot, offering rare and intimate encounters with iconic wildlife. Visit the groundbreaking Onçafari Project, which focuses on jaguar conservation and rewilding initiatives. With glowing sunset rides, Pantanal cowboy culture and incredible biodiversity, Caiman offers a meaningful and enriching blend of comfort, purpose and discovery in one of Brazil’s most remarkable landscapes. Highlights: Two shared half-day excursions daily, including 4WD wildlife safaris, Canadian canoe rides, guided hikes, and nocturnal spotlight safaris. One full-day jaguar tracking experience, with morning and late afternoon safaris led by expert trackers.
