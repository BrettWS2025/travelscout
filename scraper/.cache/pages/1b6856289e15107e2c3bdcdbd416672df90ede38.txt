Welcome to Bali. Your adventure begins in Ubud, the arts and cultural centre of Bali, with a welcome meeting at 6 pm. If you arrive early, there are many art galleries and museums to explore here, as well as plenty of woodwork, silverware and handicraft shops. Sample some local food at the famous night market or enjoy a traditional Kecak dance performance to settle into the cultural atmosphere. After your meeting tonight, maybe head out to Gianyar night market with your fellow travellers. This casual market is a great way to get a taste of the local culture and try some delicious Indonesian cuisine. Day 2: Ubud (White Water Rafting) Today, you’ll embark on a white water rafting adventure just outside of Ubud. Zoom down an 11 km-long stretch of river, navigating through Class 2 and 3 rapids against a backdrop of rainforest, shadowy gorges and rice paddies. Finish up with a hot shower – clean towels and changing rooms are available so you can get refreshed. For lunch today you’ll sit down for a group buffet before heading back to Ubud for the afternoon. Tonight, you’re free to relax or head out – your leader will always have the best dinner spots on hand! Day 3: Candidasa (Cycling) Say goodbye to leafy Ubud today and head for the foothills of Mount Agung for your day of cycling. Start close to the slopes of Mount Agung, beginning with a winding trail that takes you through lush bamboo forests and fruit orchards, then pass through local villages and rice paddies. Cycle along quiet country roads mostly downhill, with a few short hills to get your pulse racing. Your ride will finish up at White Beach – a popular spot for swimming and sunbathing. There are plenty of local warungs (cafes) here to grab some lunch. After some time to relax on the beach, you’ll transfer to your guesthouse where you’ll spend the next 2 nights. Day 4: Candidasa (Trekking) This morning you’ll drive to the lush Amlapura region to do some trekking, passing through Budakeling – a Buddhist Brahmana village – and cacao plantations. When you arrive, walk to the village of Bedandem and visit a local silversmith. Your next stop is Gumung, where a rice terrace gives you a gorgeous view of Mt Agung. Here, you might be lucky enough to join the locals in the field for the rice harvest! Your walk will end at Tirta Ganga water palace, where you can have some lunch before visiting the palace. If the mood calls, plunge into the cool water pools and refresh after a day in the sun. Day 5: Pura Luhur (Trekking) - Amed Take a minivan to Pura Luhur this morning. When you arrive, make the climb of over 1700 steps to Lempuyang Temple. The walk is paved the entire way, and it’s easy to find your way to the top. According to the locals, you shouldn't complain on your way to the top, otherwise you'll never make it! There are actually seven different temples to see at this site, so you’ll have some time to explore when you arrive. Enjoy the views of Mount Agung, Bali's highest peak, and keep an eye out for long-tailed macaques circling in the sky. After your climb, return to the base and drive to your accommodation on a black sand beach where you can finish off the day with a refreshing swim. Day 6: Amed Enjoy a free day in Amed today. Soak up the peace and quiet of this remote coastal getaway by taking a stroll along the shore or doing some yoga. While the shoreline itself is often rocky, the waters are crystal clear, making it an excellent place for snorkelling and diving, too. Those looking to discover the US Liberty wreck can put on some snorkelling gear and go exploring – just chat to your leader to organise the activity. Day 7: Senaru Travel by fast boat to Senggigi in Lombok. When you arrive, you’ll take a guided tour of the local Sasak village to learn about the history and culture of the people who live on the slopes of Mt Rinjani. Learn about their traditions and beliefs surrounding this active volcano from your local guide, who’s part of a female guiding association that trains and develops women in tourism. Later today, you’ll meet your guide for tomorrow’s full-day trek to Mt Rinaji to discuss the safety and waste management of the trek. Pack your overnight bag for tomorrow morning, then spend the rest of the night kicking back with a cool drink. Day 8: Mt Rinjani (Trekking) Begin your full-day trek to Mt Rinjani today, departing at around 7 am. Your route follows a variety of terrains, including solid dirt path, solid rock, gravel and grass. There will be plenty of stops along the way to rest your legs and take some photos. Look out for long-tail monkeys and exotic butterflies as you hike along the trail, through shady forest and open grassland. The last section of the trail is the toughest, up steep gravel and dirt paths. This takes you to the campsite just below the crater’s rim (2600 m). If it’s a clear evening, you’ll get some epic views across Bali, the Gili Islands and Mt Agung. Day 9: Mt Rinjani - Senaru (Trekking) Get up early this morning to catch the blazing sunrise from your incredible viewpoint high in the sky. After a 7 am breakfast, it's time to descend back to Senaru. A second perspective on this ever-changing environment is sure to bring new discoveries – maybe you’ll see some honeyeaters or cockatoos in the dense forest. When you get back to your accommodation, you’ll have a free evening to relax and fine a good dinner spot. Day 10: Gili Islands Today you’ll transfer from Senaru to Telak Naru. Here, you’ll take a boat to Gili Air – one of the three Gili Islands just off the coast of Lombok. This paradisical archipelago is home to beautiful white beaches, secluded bamboo huts and a beautifully clear blue-green ocean. When you arrive on the island, take the opportunity for a well-earned rest, or maybe jump straight in the ocean for a refreshing swim, soaking up the relaxing atmosphere. Tonight, you’re free to take it easy! Day 11: Gili Islands Get among the marine life on a snorkelling trip today around the crystal waters of Gili Air. After being fitted for snorkelling equipment, you’ll head out on a motorised wooden boat and cruise around the archipelago. Swim out straight off the boat to see schools of tropical fish and sea turtles. You’ll also make a few stops at different spots around the islands. Tonight, maybe head to a final group dinner and toast to a trip well travelled. Day 12: Gili Islands Your trip comes to an end today with no further activities planned. If you’re departing from the Bali or Lombok airports, please allow enough time to book a fast boat and land transfer for your return. If you’d like to extend your stay, just get in touch with your booking agent ahead of time to organise additional accommodation.
