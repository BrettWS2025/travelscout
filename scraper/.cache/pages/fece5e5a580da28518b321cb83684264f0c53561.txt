We base ourselves in a lodge on a private reserve, from where we enjoy bush walks and game drives in Mkuze and Hluhluwe, both famous for rhino conservation and diverse wildlife. Evenings are spent soaking up the tranquillity of the bush at our lodge. Day 4: Kosi Bay Kosi Bay Nature Reserve is a remarkable wetland system of lakes, mangroves, and dune forests near the Indian Ocean. We explore the area by boat, with chances to swim and snorkel among shallow reefs, and learn about traditional fishing practices unique to this region. Overnight at a local lodge. Day 5-6: Ponta do Ouro, Mozambique Crossing into Mozambique, we reach the laid-back coastal town of Ponta do Ouro. Here we join a dolphin research team on two ocean safaris, giving us the chance to snorkel, view whales and dolphins from the boat, and possibly swim with wild dolphins. This pristine stretch of coastline is a true highlight of the journey. Day 7: Maputo Heading north, we arrive in Mozambique’s vibrant capital, Maputo, set on a natural harbour. Known as the African Riviera, the city blends Portuguese and African cultures, which is reflected in its architecture, markets and cuisine. We explore landmarks on foot, and you can sample the excellent seafood in a local restaurant. Day 8-9: Inhambane Travelling along the coast, we pass through cashew and mango plantations enroute to historic Inhambane. This town showcases Arab influences and a colourful local market, before we move on to Praia de Barra for two nights beside the ocean. Relax on long white beaches, swim in warm waters, or join optional activities such as dhow sailing, scuba diving or fishing. Day 10: Chizavane We turn south to reach a secluded fishing lodge perched on sand dunes above the Indian Ocean. Low tide reveals a rocky reef that creates a calm natural pool for swimming and snorkelling, while the beach offers an idyllic setting for our last night on the coast. Dinner is a traditional fish braai overlooking the ocean. Day 11-12: Kruger National Park Crossing the border into South Africa, we enter Kruger National Park, a world-renowned haven for wildlife. We spend two days exploring the park on game drives, hoping to encounter lion, elephant, giraffe and more, while staying in comfortable chalets within the National Park. Optional night drives offer a chance to see nocturnal animals. Day 13: Greater Kruger After a final morning drive in Kruger, we head to a private lodge on the edge of the park. Relax by the pool or around the campfire and enjoy a final dinner in the African wilderness. This is a peaceful end to our safari before returning to Johannesburg. Day 14: Johannesburg – Tour Ends We start the day with an early morning game walk, giving us the chance to learn about tracks, signs and possibly spot wildlife on foot with experienced rangers. After brunch, we return to Johannesburg where the tour ends.
