You hold your breath as you capture the moment on camera, then you wait for it all to happen again. (B,L,D) DAY - 15 Location: KETCHIKAN - Alaska's "First City" of Ketchikan is so named because it is the first major landfall for most cruisers as they enter the picturesque fjords of the Inside Passage, where the town clings to the banks of the Tongass Narrows, flanked by green forests nurtured by abundant rain. An important hub of the salmon-fishing and -packing industries-visitors can try their luck on a sport-fishing excursion or simply savor the fresh seafood at one of the local restaurants.
