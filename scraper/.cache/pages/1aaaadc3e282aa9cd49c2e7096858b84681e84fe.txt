Visit Circular Quay to see the Sydney Opera House and take a walk through the Royal Botanic Gardens. Consider a harbour cruise, a walk across the Sydney Harbour Bridge, or shopping in the Queen Victoria Building. Art lovers can visit the Art Gallery of NSW, while foodies might enjoy lunch at Barangaroo or a picnic in Hyde Park. As night falls, dine at Darling Harbour or enjoy skyline views from one of Sydney’s rooftop restaurants or cocktail bars. Return to Hotel Indigo for your final night in the city.

Arrive at the tranquil Parklands Country Gardens & Lodges, nestled in the picturesque village of Blackheath, and check in to your cosy Loft Room for a two-night stay. Spend the afternoon exploring the boutique shops and cafes in Leura or Blackheath, or take a short bushwalk to a lookout like Govetts Leap. In the evening, relax by the fireplace or enjoy a quiet dinner at a local mountain restaurant. Day 5: Discover Scenic World & Blue Mountains Today, your Scenic World Ultimate Discovery Pass gives you access to one of the region’s most exciting experiences. Ride the Scenic Skyway across the Jamison Valley, descend into the rainforest on the Scenic Cableway, and experience the thrill of the Scenic Railway – the world’s steepest passenger railway. Walk among ancient trees on the rainforest boardwalk and enjoy panoramic views of the Three Sisters, Katoomba Falls, and the expansive wilderness. After a day of adventure, return to Parklands to unwind in serene surrounds and reflect on the beauty of the Blue Mountains. Day 6: Sydney After breakfast, check out and begin your return drive to Sydney, which takes approximately two hours.
