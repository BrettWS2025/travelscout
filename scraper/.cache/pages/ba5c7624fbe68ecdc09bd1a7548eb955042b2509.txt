(Or Walyalup in the language of the local Whadjuk Noongar people, who are the Traditional Owners of the land on which Fremantle and Perth are now located.) Your adventure starts on the west coast of the Australian mainland with a welcome meeting at 6 pm?tonight. If you arrive early, maybe visit the Maritime Museum or wander through the Fremantle Markets. After your meeting, get to know your new fellow travellers and your leader (and get excited about the journey ahead) during dinner at a nearby restaurant. Day 2 Rottnest Island to Fremantle This morning, you’ll take the scenic boat ride to Rottnest Island – a little white-sand paradise off the coast. Maybe grab a coffee, then, as is customary here, try to grab a quick quokka selfie – these little marsupials have earned the title of ‘world’s friendliest animals’ and are usually happy around people! Your leader will guide you across the island on a hop on hop off vehicle that’s always rotating around the island. You have most of the day free here to enjoy the many swimming bays, beaches and snorkelling spots around the island. Take the afternoon ferry back to Fremantle later today. Day 3 Busselton to Leeuwin-Naturaliste National Park to Margaret River This morning, drive to Margaret River, with a few stops along the way. First, you’ll have the chance to grab some lunch in Busselton – home to the longest timber-piled jetty in the Southern Hemisphere. Stretch your legs and explore the lovely foreshore before continuing the scenic coastal drive, stopping at Meelup Beach, Cape Naturaliste and Sugarloaf Rock. Have your swimsuit ready at Meelup Beach – this is a beautiful spot for a quick dip. Take in the white sand and clear waters and relax in the shady, grassy areas before making your way to Cape Naturaliste and Sugarloaf Rock – a granite rock that juts out from the Indian Ocean near the mainland in Leeuwin-Naturaliste National Park. Here, you’ll walk to the lookout point and have time for photos. Tonight, stay in Margaret River and maybe stroll down the main street before dinner. Day 4 Margaret River This morning, drive to Yallingup – a hub of beaches and limestone caves. When you arrive, journey into Ngilgi Cave on a bushwalk with a local Aboriginal guide and learn how to identify traditional plants, foods and medicines and how they are linked to the six Nyoongar seasons. Then, head into the cave and watch a captivating didgeridoo performance, amplified by the superb acoustics.?Discover the tools and cultural artefacts used by the Wadandi people in their everyday life and listen to stories about their history and culture. After, sit down for lunch at a local brewery before visiting a winery for a tasting session of their range of fully estate-grown wines – this afternoon is all about local produce! Head to another winery where you can maybe view the production line and taste some freshly made nougat or treat yourself to another wine, then cap it all off with a gin tasting at a nearby distillery. Tonight, maybe keep the fun going with dinner at a local pub. Day 5 Yallingup to Margaret River to Perth Head towards the coast this morning for breakfast at a beachside cafe overlooking the Indian Ocean surf. Then, set off on a beach walk to where the Margaret River empties into the ocean before heading to Perth. Along the way, stop for a chocolate tasting at a local producer and visit Lake Clifton – known for its thrombolites (rock-like structures) built by micro-organisms that live in the lake. When you arrive in Perth, your leader will take you to Kings Park for panoramic views. Your trip then comes to an end with a drop-off at your centrally located hotel.
