Show more Day 1 London (England) London’s a-calling. Touch down in the Big Smoke: head straight to your central accommodation, where the adventure officially kicks off. After checking in, it’s time to meet your fellow travellers and Trip Leader - who you’ll be swapping stories with in no time. Our first feast: tonight, you’ll gather for your very first group dinner. Forget what you’ve heard about British cuisine - it’s comforting, hearty, and way more delicious than it gets credit for. Later your way: feeling the flight fuzz? Head back for a chilled evening and settle in. Or, if the jet lag hasn’t hit, follow the buzz to a nearby pub - you’ll likely find live music, craft beers, and probably a friendly dog or two. Let the good times begin. Day 2 London - Paris (France) Paris, we’re coming in hot. All aboard the Eurostar: say au revoir to London and bonjour to buttery pastries - you’ll zoom through the countryside and land in the heart of Paris faster than you can say pain au chocolat. Seine soirée: tonight, float through the City of Light on a dreamy river cruise. The Eiffel Tower will be doing its sparkly thing, and if you’ve BYO’d a snack stash from the local Franprix, even better. Paris at night? Pure magic. Day 3 Paris Paris, pastries, and (possibly) snails. A sweet start: whether you're pedalling past Paris’s icons on the optional bike tour, or plotting your own croissant crawl, the morning’s yours to soak up the city your way. Bonus points if you manage to eat your weight in pain au chocolat. Afternoon in Montmartre: next stop? Montmartre - the bohemian heart of Paris where artists, dreamers, and possibly your new favourite éclair hang out. Expect winding streets, sweeping views, and a walking tour that feeds both your eyes and your appetite - with everything from flaky pastries to slippery escargot, all wrapped up as a late lunch. Dignity optional. Day 4 Paris Palaces, portraits or piles of bones - it’s your Paris, your way. Get exploring: fancy feeling fancy? Join the optional trip to Versailles and swan through golden halls like it’s 1788. More into art? Head to the Louvre and give Mona a nod (just ignore the army of selfie sticks). Or, if you’re in the mood for something a little darker, the Paris Catacombs are calling - skulls, tunnels and spine-tingling guaranteed. Dinner like a local: this evening, you’re eating like a local - think crusty baguettes, melty cheese and maybe something you can’t pronounce but will absolutely love. Later, your way: go full sparkle at an optional cabaret show (you can expect feathers, fizz and high kicks), or grab a front-row seat to Parisian people-watching from a snug little brasserie. Day 5 Paris - Bordeaux Paris behind you, Bordeaux ahead - time to wine down in style. Bonjour Bordeaux: after one last croissant (or three), we'll be zipping to south to France’s wine capital. Taste and toast: welcome to Bordeaux - all cobbled lanes, sun-soaked vineyards and a city that treats grapes like gold. This afternoon, channel your inner wine critic on a welcome walk with an included tasting. Whether you detect notes of oak, berries, or simply “yep, that’s wine,” you’ll leave feeling just that little bit fancier. Santé!! Day 6 Bordeaux Your day, your Bordeaux adventure - where ‘bored’ simply isn’t on the menu. Step out and explore: roam the chic Golden Triangle, where stunning architecture meets high-end boutiques and tempting gourmet shops (don’t miss the Place de la Bourse and its dazzling water mirror - perfect for some epic reflection shots). Or swing by a cozy fromagerie, pick up a selection of local cheeses, and settle into Jardin Public for a perfectly indulgent picnic. Your Trip Leader’s got the inside scoop on must-visits if you’re looking for inspiration. Day 7 Bordeaux - Barcelona (Spain) Bye for now, Bordeaux - next stop: buzzy Barcelona. All aboard for sun-soaked Barcelona: kick back and enjoy the ride as we trade wine country views for buzzing city streets. Gaudí time: welcome to mediterranean sunshine and a city buzzing with life! Once you’ve dropped your bags, get ready to be amazed by an included guided tour of Sagrada Família - part cathedral, part fever dream, completely unforgettable. Flamenco fire: cap off your day with an optional flamenco show that’s all drama, passion, and foot-stomping flair. Ole! Day 8 Barcelona Local bites and historic delights. Step back in time: start your day with a guided wander through the enchanting Gothic Quarter, where narrow streets hide stories as rich as the city itself. Keep your eyes peeled for secret squares, ancient cathedrals, and plenty of photo-worthy moments. Taste buds, get ready: next, it’s time to tantalize your taste buds at Mercat de Santa Caterina - your included lunch stop for the day. Expect to nibble on crispy croquettes, creamy cheeses, salty jamon, and briny olives - a feast of local flavours that’ll keep you coming back for more. After-dark bites: cap off your evening with a laid-back group dinner where you can swap stories and soak up the buzz of Barcelona by night. Day 9 Barcelona Gaudí, beaches, and pintxos - Barcelona at its best! Morning magic in Gaudí’s playground: kick off the day with a wander through Parc Güell, where mosaic lizards and candy-coloured benches make for a whimsical start. Then it’s your time to explore - whether that’s the striking Casa Vicens or the stunning Barcelona Cathedral, history and art are waiting around every corner. Sun, sea, and stadiums: head down to La Barceloneta for some well-deserved beach time - dip your toes in the Med or just soak up the lively atmosphere. More into football than flip-flops? Make your way to Camp Nou, the iconic home of FC Barcelona, for a peek at soccer history and passion. Barcelona is yours to explore! Evening eats and bright lights: when night falls, join an optional tapas tour and treat your taste buds to a flavourful journey through the city’s best small plates - perfect for swapping juicy stories and enjoying every last bite, because shenanigans always tastes better when shared. Day 10 Barcelona - Madrid From Barcelona buzz to Madrid mischief. First steps in the capital: after arriving in Madrid, your Trip Leader will lead a lively walking tour through Madrid’s highlights - from the regal Palacio Real and the stunning Catedral de Santa María to the buzzing Plaza Mayor and charming Plaza de la Villa. Taste the city: finish up with a stop at either Mercado San Miguel for foodie delights or Antón Martin for something a little different - the tastings here serve as your lunch, so grab a plate, sample your way through local flavours, and enjoy a proper midday feast. Day 11 Madrid Madrid: your personal playground. Art and antics in the Spanish capital: today is yours to make memorable. Get your culture fix with masterpieces at the Prado or Reina Sofía, then kick back with a leisurely stroll or a cheeky paddle boat ride in El Retiro Park, a lush, leafy and unexpected oasis, smack bang in the heart of the city. Next, strut down Gran Vía - Madrid’s buzzing Broadway - where shops, theatres, and jaw-dropping architecture make every step feel like a scene from a movie. And hey, don’t leave Madrid without trying Huevos Rotos con Jamón - crispy fried potatoes piled high with salty cured ham and topped with perfectly fried eggs. When those golden yolks break, they create the ultimate sauce for a classic, comforting bite that’s pure Madrid magic. Cheers to Madrid: cap off your day with an optional tapas tour, the perfect way to taste the city’s unique flavours and raise a glass to your first full day in the Spanish capital. Day 12 Madrid - Lisbon (Portugal) From Spanish siestas to Portuguese pastéis. Adiós Madrid, olá Lisboa: it’s time to trade tapas for pastéis de nata as you journey from Spain to Portugal. Sit back, relax and watch the landscapes change on today’s journey - think rolling hills, sunflower fields, olive groves, and the occasional medieval hilltop town. Pro tip: pack some snacks, charge your headphones, and queue up that travel playlist. As you near Portugal, keep your eyes peeled for glimpses of the Tagus River and those signature azulejo tiles that start popping up. You’ll arrive in Lisbon late afternoon, ready to stretch your legs and start soaking up the city’s vibrant charm. Lisbon by night: once you’ve checked in, the evening is yours. Grab your camera and head up to Miradouro da Senhora do Monte for epic sunset views, or wander the cobbled streets of Alfama, where live Fado (traditional Portuguese music) drifts from tucked-away taverns. Feeling peckish? Join the locals queuing for a bifana sandwich (a drool-worthy fare with thin slices of marinated pork). Day 13 Lisbon Tuk tuks, trams and tarts. Tuk tuk takeover: this morning, hop aboard your very own tuk tuk for a whizz through Lisbon’s old town. With a local expert at the wheel and tile-covered buildings at every turn, this is sightseeing with a soundtrack (those cobbles are no joke). You’ll be picked up right from your accommodation - all you have to do is sit back, snap pics, and soak it all in. Choose-your-own-adventure: after the tour, it’s your time to roam. Fancy hopping on the iconic yellow Tram 28? Go for it. Want to wander Alfama’s twisty, sun-dappled alleyways with no map and no plan? Highly encouraged. This city was made for getting lost in. At some point, follow your nose (and your heart) to Manteigaria for Lisbon’s most talked-about pastel de nata. Buttery, flaky, custardy perfection - and best eaten warm, with a light sprinkling of cinnamon. Dinner plans, sorted: come evening, it’s time to regroup for a celebratory finale feast. Expect good food, great company, and the kind of table you won’t want to leave. Day 14 Lisbon Pastel de perfect, Lisbon: what a finale. Farewell for now: after breakfast, it’s time for goodbyes. Whether you're heading home or onto your next adventure, you’ll leave your European escapade with camera rolls full of colour, a newfound love for flaky croissants and creamy custard tarts, and that sun-soaked, cobbled-street magic lingering long after the last goodbye.
