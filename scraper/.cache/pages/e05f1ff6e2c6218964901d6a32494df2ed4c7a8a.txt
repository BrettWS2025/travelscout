Later, visit Pisa and its UNESCO-listed 'Square of Miracles' to view the architectural feat that is the Leaning Tower. Day 5 - Onwards to San Gimignano and Florence Connect with Locals The gentle Tuscan landscape leads us to our next destination, the hilltop town of San Gimignano, famed for its stunning medieval architecture and historic towers, which stand today as a testament to the wealth and power of aristocratic families who lived here centuries ago.
