There is no need for high heels, handbags or suits here! On an island as remote as this you can have all the space you want, with just 18 Beachfront Bures hidden among the shady palms, each one just a few steps from the beach, your privacy is guaranteed. The resort offers a selection of complimentary scheduled activities throughout the week. An excursion out to the famous Sawa-i-Lau Caves (Blue Lagoon Caves) is a must do. It features spectacular limestone caverns and turquoise lagoon pools. The resort operates a weekly complimentary excursion to the caves, requesting guests provide a donation to the village to access the caves. Alternatively, you can fill your days with guided snorkelling trips, private beach picnics or spend some time visiting a nearby Fijian village. This is truly a holiday where you can do as much as you want, or as little. View more View less 7 nights + transfers & more from $ 5979 per person share twin. Flights are additional.
