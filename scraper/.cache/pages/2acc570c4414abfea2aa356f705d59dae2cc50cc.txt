Remainder of day at leisure. Day 2: Istanbul (B) Embark on a full day guided tour of some of the best sites of Istanbul, the city where east meets west. Originally founded as Byzantium, then known as Constantinople, after Constantine the Great, Istanbul is home to many fascinating sites. The first stop on your tour is Topkapi Palace, once the main residence of the Ottoman Sultans and now a fascinating museum. Next, view the incredible Hagia Sophia Mosque from the outside - originally built in 537ad, this marvel of engineering is famed for the giant dome, an incredible feat for the time period and considered as one of the world's greatest architectural wonders. Continue to the Blue Mosque built between 1609 and 1616 and famous for its blue ceramic tiles. Conclude your tour with a visit to the famous Grand Bazaar, one of the largest and oldest covered markets in the world featuring an intricate labyrinth of over 60 streets and 4000 shops. Day 3: Istanbul - Ankara – Cappadocia (B,D) This morning depart for Ankara where you will visit the Mausoleum of Ataturk and its Museum. This is the burial place of the national hero who founded the modern Republic of Turkey. After a picturesque trip along the Salt Lake, one of the largest hypersaline lakes in the world, arrive in Cappadocia for a two-night stay. Day 4: Cappadocia (B,L) Embark on a full day excursion in Cappadocia, famous for its distinctive rock formations (referred to as 'fairy chimneys'), amazing caves and historical history. Visit the Underground City, the Open- Air Museum in Goreme and the incredible natural fortress in Uchisar. Lunch today in a local restaurant. This afternoon, you will have the opportunity to discover and understand the rich history behind local handicrafts like hand-made carpets, Turkish tiles, onyx, and potteries. Overnight stay in Cappadocia. Optional (surcharge applies): Early morning balloon tour Day 5: Cappadocia - Konya - Pamukkale (B,D) Early departure for Pamukkale. Pamukkale, meaning "Cotton Castle" in Turkish, derived its name from the striking natural landscape and is famous for its travertine terraces made from minerals deposited by thermal waters. En-route visit the 13th century Seljukian masterpiece, Sultanhan Caravanserai - one of the best examples of Seljuk architecture in Turkey and one of the largest medieval caravanserai in the country - built to shelter the caravaneers, their animals and cargo and keep them safe from highwaymen as they travelled along the ancient Silk Route. Proceed to Konya where you will visit the Mausoleum of Mevlana, housing the tomb of Mevlana Rumi the great 13th-century Sufi poet and founder of the Mevlevi (Whirling) Dervish order. Continue to Pamukkale for an overnight stay. Day 6: Pamukkale - Hierapolis - Izmir (B,D) Explore the ancient city of Hierapolis, with its spectacular ruins and magnificent Necropolis, one of the best preserved in Turkey offering an insight into the funerary practices of the Greco-Roman era. Marvel at the spectacular lime terraces cascading down the side of the hill before travelling on to Selcuk to visit the Temple of Artemis ''one of the seven wonders of the ancient world''. Proceed to Izmir for a two-night stay. Day 7: Izmir - Ephesus - Sirince - Izmir (B,L,D) Today discover the ancient city of Ephesus, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and one of Turkey's most significant ancient cities. Explore its marbled streets, visit the magnificent Library of Celsus, the impressive open-air Amphitheatre, and the Temple of Hadrian dating back to the 2nd Century. Lunch today will be in a nomadic tent in Selcuk to taste Turkish Gozleme. Continue to the village of Sirince, where you can experience one of the most beautiful villages in Turkey and take the opportunity to taste their delicious wines, before returning to Izmir. Overnight stay in Izmir. Day 8: Izmir - Pergamum - Canakkale (B,D) Early departure for Bergama to visit the Asklepion with its well preserved remains before you step into mythology with a visit to Troy, the scene of heroic deeds from such legends as Achilles, Paris, Ulysses, Priam, and the incomparably beautiful Helen – “the face that launched a thousand ships.” Immortalised by Homer in his epic The Iliad, Troy was thought to be entirely fictitious until it was discovered by pioneering archaeologist Heinrich Schliemann in the 1870’s. The replica wooden horse adds further depth to the experience. Later continue to Canakkale for an overnight stay. Day 9: Canakkale - Gallipoli - Istanbul (B) After breakfast, cross the Dardanelles for a special day for New Zealand and Australian travellers with a visit to Gallipoli. On arrival, visit Anzac Cove, Nek, Chunuk Bair, Lone Pine Cemetery and the 57th Regiment Memorial. The doomed assault on Gallipoli by New Zealand and Australian forces, in their own contingents for the first time in foreign service, is considered by many to have been the birth of national consciousness for these two countries. For the Turks, then part of the Ottoman Empire, the victory is regarded as the defining moment in the birth of the Turkish nation, with independence following just 8 years later. Arrival in Istanbul for an overnight stay. Day 10: Istanbul (B) After breakfast transfer to Istanbul airport for your onward arrangements.
