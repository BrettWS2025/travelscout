Or Gimuy, in the language of the Traditional Owners of the land on which Cairns is now located. This is the gateway to Australia’s Great Barrier Reef and the gorgeous Daintree Rainforest. Your adventure officially starts with a welcome meeting at 6 pm tonight at your hotel, where you’ll meet your trip leader and fellow travellers. If you arrive in Cairns with time to spare, why not check out the Cairns Botanical Gardens or simply wander the waterfront promenade, popping into a local bar. After the meeting, maybe head out with your group for a dinner. Day 2: Cape Tribulation / Rossville Today, you’ll take the Daintree ferry to the UNESCO World Heritage area of Cape Tribulation, which sits within the ancient Daintree Rainforest. When you arrive, head out on a short nature walk and immerse yourself in the sounds and smells of the forest, keeping your eye out for local birdlife. Daintree is over 135 million years old, making it the oldest rainforest in the world! Stop at a lookout and enjoy the beach scenery, then hop into your 4WD truck for a drive along the iconic Bloomfield Track – also known as the Coast Road, this track takes you from the cape through the forest’s many creeks. After, carry on to Rossville for the night, and maybe join your group for dinner at The Lion Den Hotel. After some pub food, spend the night stargazing at your campsite, overlooked by the Kalkajaka (Black Mountain). Day 3: Rossville / Cooktown / Laura Fuel up on breakfast this morning, then say goodbye to the rainforest to make tracks for Laura. Along the way, stop in a remote town and meet with your local Aboriginal guide. Attend a Welcome to Country and smoking ceremony, then take a bush food and medicine walk as your guide tells you stories about the land. You’ll learn more about Country and boomerang throwing as your guide shares some handmade artefacts. Have tea together and soak up your opportunity to connect with the land. Then stop at the Cooktown History Centre and learn about the significance of Cooktown and what role it played in Aboriginal history. Then, you’ll have the opportunity to take the self-guided walk to Quinkan Country’s rock art in Laura –included on the Australian Heritage Estate and listed by UNESCO as one of the top 10 rock art sites in the world. Day 4: Lakefield National Park / Coen After breakfast, make tracks for Rinyurru Lakefield National Park. When you arrive, step back in time at the Old Laura Homestead, which dates back to 1879, and immerse yourself in one of the park's most historically significant periods. Then, head to Red Lily Lagoon to spot the waterbirds and pink lotus-lilies that carpet the lagoon. After a short walk, you’ll carry on to another peaceful lagoon, where a hundred-year-old mango tree marks the site of a historic family homestead. Have lunch on the North Kennedy River, then visit the termite mounts and grasslands of Nifold Plains. Arrive in Coen in the late afternoon – a rural town on the eastern side of the Cape York peninsula – where you’ll spend the night at camp. Day 5: Iron Range National Park This morning, you’ll continue north to Kutini-Payamu (Iron Range) National Park – the largest area of lowland tropical rainforest in Australia – through Cape York’s wilderness. Stop at Mount Tozer viewpoint and take a short walk for views of the mountain that rises in the distance. Next, visit the small coastal community of Portland Roads. This remote tropical outpost is a historical site framed by mangroves and famous for its small local cafe. If it’s open, maybe sit down for a coffee and a snack before heading to Chilli Beach – a long, sweeping beach, popular for fishing and birdwatching. Chill out under the swaying palms and take in the remote beach landscape, then head to your campsite. Day 6: Iron Range National Park / Wenlock River Maybe rise early this morning and go bird watching in the surrounding rain forest – if you’re lucky, you may spot the elusive palm cockatoo, red-bellied pitta and yellow-billed kingfisher. Just a short drive from your campsite is Lockhart River Arts Indigenous Corporation – established in 1995, the artists of Lockhart River Art Centre have been recognised for many years as ‘The Art Gang’. You’ll visit here before heading to your campground on the Wenlock River – you'll be staying at Moreton Telegraph Station for the next two nights, which was part of the Cape York Telegraph line, completed in 1887. Day 7: Weipa / Wenlock River This morning, you’ll drive to the Western Cape Cultural Centre. Here, you’ll learn about the history and culture of the region of Weipa and its surrounding communities. This centre plays an important role in preserving traditional language within the region through informative displays and artworks. After, you’ll hop on a boat cruise to see Cape York from the water – look out for saltwater crocodiles and the numerous bird species that live in these waterways and mangroves and learn about the local culture and wildlife habitats. After, visit Lake Patricia and head out on a short walk with your leader around the area. Tonight, you’ll have dinner back at your campground on the river and spend another night under the stars. Day 8: Apudthama National Park / Seisia This morning, you’ll carry on to Kennedy’s Lost Camp to learn about Edmund Besley Court Kennedy J. P. – an Australian explorer in the mid-19th-century, known for his knowledge of (and untimely end in) Cape York. You’ll then visit Fruit Bat Falls, which sits within Apudthama National Park. These lush, bushy falls are a beautiful spot for a nature walk and a swim. After, carry on to the Jardine River ferry for the short journey to Seisia – home to the most northerly mainland community in Queensland and a gorgeous spot with a beach, still waters and palm trees. You’ll spend the next three nights in the local caravan park and have dinner with your group at the site. Day 9: Pajinka / Cape York / Seisia Today, you’ll drive to the northernmost point of the mainland of Australia – Pajinka. Once you cross this mighty spot off your bucket list with a walk along the inland route, carry on to Somerset Beach and Fly Point for a beach visit and some photos, trying to spot the resident turtles. Then, carry on to the plane wreckage from World War II – located throughout Cape York, there are now plane wreckages where there were functioning Allied air bases during the war. These are a reminder of how close the fight really was to Australian shores. End the day with a visit to the remote community of Injinoo (also known as Cowal Creek or Small River) then take some time to wander through the town of Bamaga and stock up on snacks before making your way back to Seisia for the night. Day 10: Thursday Island (Torres Strait) / Seisia This morning, you’ll take the ferry to Thursday Island for a cultural activity with a local Torres Strait Islander guide. When you arrive, learn more about the culture of the Torres Strait Islander people on a guided walk along Bayo Beach. After lunch, jump back aboard the ferry for your last night in Seisia. Day 11: Seisia / Cairns Today after breakfast, you’ll say goodbye to Seisia and take a transfer to Bamaga Airport, where you’ll leave your leader and take an unaccompanied flight back to Cairns. When you arrive, your adventure will come to an end at the airport. If you’d like to extend your stay in Cairns, just speak to your booking agent ahead of time.
