After begging my way into a cafe job at 14, I then spent 12 years working in the hospitality industry supervising restaurants and managing specialty cafes which also founded my love for all different types of foods. After spending 3 years in Melbourne, 6 months in South East Asia and a few years in the UK I finally made the switch to the travel industry where I have been able to share my love for travel and customer service ever since. I made it through the dark years of COVID in the industry which has led me to know to dig that little bit deeper into my clients' travel plans to create that perfect trip, and ensure we really have the best option for you in terms of comfort, reliability, and service. As we just don't know what is round the corner, do we! I've travelled extensively across Southeast Asia, UK and Europe, spent a lot of time exploring properties in Fiji (and relaxing by the beach), road tripped in California and in 2024 I visited South Africa in Feb, Japan, South Korea and Taipei!

My ultimate passion when I travel is trying local foods, and finding the best possible places to have that authentic experience that we wouldn't be able to have at home.

Customer holidays snaps Best. Bali Holidays. Ever! Follow us! FAQS Planning to visit Bali What is the best time to visit Bali? Anytime is a good time to go to Bali, but we recommend April to October, where the temperatures average 30+ degrees and there’s less humidity. Australian school holidays are always busy so if you don’t have to travel when ‘schools out’, be sure to check your dates. Bali does have both a wet and dry seasons: typically, dry season is April to September, wet season runs from October to March, where you can expect a downpour every day, however it’s unlikely to last long. Air New Zealand operates direct flights from Auckland year around making Bali an easy holiday option for Kiwis. Where to go on holiday in Bali? Bali offers an array of beach options including Legian and Seminyak both great for dining. Or visit Sanur, this was originally a fishing village but now you can soak up the charm along the beachfront boardwalk. Visit Ubud for cultural experiences, wellness and adventure or head to Nusa Dua for luxury resorts. Don’t miss the beautiful temples like Tanah Lot and Uluwatu.

Bali has something for everyone, travelling in a group…choose a villa, if you’re a foodie head to Seminayk, or a hard-core surfer? - catch a wave in Uluwatu. Bali has accommodation options for every budget, taste and style. Bali is a perfect break for people who want a relaxing, well-being break or an adventure-filled escape with amazing nightlife, good food and a touch of culture. What should I pack for my trip to Bali? Don’t leave home without your sunscreen! You’ll be spending a lot of time outdoors and a happy traveller is one that isn’t bright red! Insect repellent should also be packed plus a few other essentials. Don’t forget your power adapter & chargers either! Bring enough cash to see you through the first few days. There are numerous ATM’s in the main beach areas so accessing money is not a problem. Let your bank know you’re travelling to Bali too, so they will be aware in advance of any international transactions. What to wear? Light clothing is best, but if you are heading to a temple, respect their culture. Do I need travel insurance for Bali? Yes, it is highly recommended to have travel insurance for your trip to Bali. We offer a range of travel insurance options suitable for travel to Bali. Find more information on our website. Can I use New Zealand dollars in Bali? No, you will need to exchange your New Zealand dollars (NZD) for Indonesian rupiah (IDR). Currency exchange services are available at airports, banks, and exchange bureaus. Credit and debit cards are widely accepted in tourist areas. While you are there How to get around in Bali? Once you’ve arrived in Bali, we recommend having an organised transfer with guide waiting for you when you clear customs. Once settled in at your accommodation, beating the feet for a short walk is a good way to get your bearings. Download the ‘GRAB’ app or locally they have ‘GOJEK’ to get around (similar to Uber). If your holiday entails more than days at the beach and you want to explore more, consider hiring a driver. It starts from as little as $60 per day and is a smart idea. You get driven from door-to-door and can sit back and absorb all the highlights. Your driver will take you to sites you might not have found yourself, and you’ll get insider’s knowledge from a genuine local. When planning your adventures, be prepared, traffic can be heavy so when making plans, always add in some extra time to get there. What are some of the cultural dos and don'ts in Bali? Bali is a fairly relaxed place, and many locals are used to the number of tourists that visit annually. Remember that bartering is mostly only accepted at markets and street stalls and won’t be well received in malls or boutiques. Tipping is not essential but welcomed. Remember, If visiting a place of worship or a temple, you will need to be well covered. Many temples open for tourists do provide clothing to be worn before you enter the temple surrounds, and shoes may also need to be removed at some places. What are some family-friendly activities in Bali? Bali is a great family destination with a large range of fun activities. A lot of the resorts are family friendly with big pools, kids’ clubs and a lot to keep them occupied. Visit Waterbom Bali in Kuta for extreme water slides and a fun filled day for kids of all ages. It’s guaranteed to provide hours of entertainment and fun for all.
