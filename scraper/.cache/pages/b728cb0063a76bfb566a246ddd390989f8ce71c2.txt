Welcome to Tirana! Tonight, you’ll have the chance to chat &amp; eat with your brand new crew over a welcome dinner at a charming local restaurant. Day 2 - Tirana Sun’s out, buns out. (No really, go get your breakfast…). Today’s all about epic views, history &amp; some more epic views. First, we’ll take the cable car up to Dajti Mountain where jaw-dropping views of the city await us. Then, we’ll head back down where a local guide will show us around the city’s historical buildings - where you’ll get to try local olive oil. The rest of the day is all yours. And luckily, there’s plenty of stuff here to keep you entertained. Day 3 - Tirana > Vlorë Time to turn up the dial… coz we’re seeing the Albanian Riviera today! After breakfast, we’ll say goodbye to Tirana and hop onto our coach for a short drive to our next stop. Turquoise waters, golden sand - that's how you know we’re in a coastal wonderland. You can choose to spend all day unwinding on the stunning beaches. Or take a boat tour to the National Marine Park with views of rugged coastlines &amp; lush green hills. For dinner, maybe you’d like to join us at a traditional, family-owned restaurant (inside a literal vineyard) for a wholesome dine &amp; wine experience. Day 4 - Vlorë > Himarë > Porto Palermo Bay > Vlorë Wakey wakey, we’ve got some more beach destinations to tick off today. No, you’re not in the Maldives. This is the Albanian Riviera! You’ve got some time today to check out the beaches and streets of this beautiful hidden gem. Then, we’ll make our way to a stunning little bay. There’s a castle. There’s a sparkling blue bay. And there’s some time for you to explore ‘em. Then, on our way back to Vlorë - we’ll stop by to witness a unique performance of traditional Albanian singing. With our bodies all travel-tired, there’s only one thing on our minds: dinner. So we’ll walk about town and grab food. Next thing on the agenda? A good night’s sleep. Day 5 - Vlorë > Fishtë > Shkodër This morning is all about recharging &amp; relaxing by the sandy beach. After lunch, we’ll drive to another shiny new destination. Sprawling fields, rolling hills and tranquil panoramas - that’s how you’ll be greeted at Fishtë. This evening, we'll gorge on a delicious, homegrown dinner (with glorious vineyard views as the backdrop). Ahh, life’s good. Isn’t it? Equipped with a new sense of serenity, tonight we’ll rest in a wonderful traditional hotel here. Day 6 - Shkodër > Koman > Valbonë Rise &amp; shine travellers, we’ve got a long day ahead of us. Fill up on breakfast at the hotel and let’s get started… It’s ferry time! You’ll cruise along the breathtaking valleys and hills surrounding Lake Komani towards Feirya. Then, a short drive later, we’ll have arrived at Valbonë. If the boat cruise has impressed you already, just wait till you see what's next. After checking into the guesthouse we will head off for an afternoon hiking in Valbonë National Park - passing by tranquil rivers, jaw-dropping valleys and rocky cliffs along the way. Then, we’ll finish it all off with a hearty dinner back in our guesthouse. Day 7 - Valbonë > Prizren > Tirana Wave goodbye to the mountains. A different adventure awaits us today. That’s right, this morning we’re going to Kosovo! This beautiful old town is studded with restaurants that are perfect if you wanna try the local cuisine. Then you’ve got some time to explore the cobblestone streets here, before we continue onto Tirana. Tirana, did ya miss us? You'll have the option to grab your pals and head to a restaurant in the city to enjoy some local eats (It's our last evening together sadly). Then, it’s back to the hotel for a well deserved snooze. Day 8 - Tirana Oh, what a treat it has been… 8 days of beautiful beaches, perfect peaks and undisturbed exploration. Grab your final breakfast here. And grab your friends’ socials too. The only thing left to do now is plan your next trip together! More Deals Enquire *Terms and Conditions Offer subject to availability at time of booking.
