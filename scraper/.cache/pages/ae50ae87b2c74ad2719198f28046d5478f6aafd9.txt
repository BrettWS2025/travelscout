Table Mountain, endless beaches, and big city scenes, all this and much more are ready to welcome you today. Explore the heart of the city and get a first-hand feel of this cosmopolitan buzz, before starting the trip off right, with your Travel Director and your fellow travellers, where excitement will be riding high. Day 2 - Cape Town Orientation and Free Time In what the locals call the ‘Mother City’, we’ll waste no time getting started. For us, there’s no better way to do it than an essential morning orientation tour to really get your bearings. Your Travel Director will paint a vivid picture of each and every spot, from the colourful facades and houses in Bo-Kaap to the lush Company Gardens and the 17th-century Castle of Good Hope. You’ll soon feel like you’re a part of history itself. Standing tall, the main event of today sees us hitting all new heights at you guessed it, Table Mountain via the iconic aerial cable way. As we pause to take in the 360-degree views stretching down the City Bowl, Atlantic Seaboard and beyond you’re sure to hear a collective ‘ahhhh’. With Table Mountain checked off, tailoring your afternoon is up next, with options that are just as iconic as the sights. Choose to take a relaxed e-bike ride along the beach before feeling the sand in your toes at a sunset beach braai (barbeque). Day 3 - Cape Town Free Day Today is about taking in Cape Town and surrounds, your way, and you’ll have options galore. Wine lovers could choose to pop the cork and sip their way through the day in the Cape Winelands, via the Franschhoek Wine Tram. Other options for those whose perfect day is the great outdoors, lace your boots up for a guided hike to the top of Table Mountain, or take it up a notch on a thrilling mountain-biking trail. Day 4 - Cape Town - Johannesburg - Mabula Game Reserve Farewell Cape Town, it’s been a dream. But as they say, all good things must come to an end. You're in for a treat though, as another adventure in the form of a safari, awaits today! We board our included flight and say a quick hello to Johannesburg, before hopping straight to it as we make tracks to Mabula Game Reserve, home to the main event. Set against the picturesque backdrop of the UNESECO-listed Waterberg Mountains, the fantasy of coming to Africa will really set in. Wild, open and magical, in our 4x4 vehicle, it will be all eyes peeled as the sun sets over the bushveld and the animals begin to emerge. Day 5 - Mabula Game Reserve Safari Game Drives You’ll be rising early today as we go in search of lion, leopard, rhino, elephant, and buffalo that make up the magnificent Big 5, and there’s no better way to do it than with your Local Guide leading the charge. Feel like a true explorer as we navigate the dusty tracks in pursuit of spotting animals in both the vegetation and sparse open spaces while learning all about the area under our Guide’s expert knowledge of the area. Whether you spot the Big 5 or not, there’s no doubt you’ll enjoy this truly magical experience. So take a moment to put your camera down and soak up sights, sounds, and smells of Africa. Day 6 - Mabula Game Reserve - Johannesburg We’ll bid a fond farewell to the bushveld, tucking into a tasty breakfast, and just like that it's time to head back to civilisation to our next city stop. Johannesburg is hard to resist, get your bearings first up with an orientation of its sights and sounds with your Travel Director. With an afternoon to explore your way take the opportunity to get a history fix at Soweto, delving into the infamous history of South Africa's oldest township and once home to two Nobel Peace Prize winners. For a slice of adventure, consider donning a helmet to explore the Sterkfontein Caves and wander the Maropeng Visitor Centre, where humanity’s origin story comes to life through interactive exhibits. However you choose to explore this afternoon, you’ll be sure to have taken away a piece of why people fall in love with the people and energy in this vibrant city. Day 7 - Johannesburg - Victoria Falls The ‘smoke that thunders', otherwise known as Victoria Falls, awaits today. After an included morning flight, you’ll be feeling like a VIP at our accommodation, located right on the banks of the mighty Zambezi River. This river is the lifeblood of Victoria Falls and home to hippos, crocodiles and playful elephants. You will spot these water-loving creatures if you choose to end the day with our optional experience - a blissful sunset cruise. Day 8 - Victoria Falls Sightseeing and Free Time One of the Seven Natural Wonders of the World, the main event is up next, a guided tour with your Local Specialist of Victoria Falls. It will be hard to pull your jaw from the floor today because these thunderous falls, standing at 108m (354ft), make up the world’s largest sheet of falling water that show Mother Nature at her best. Later, take time to explore life in the slow lane. Whether you want to wander little galleries or open air markets, there’s no shortage of ways to end the day. Day 9 - Free Day in Victoria Falls Today is at leisure, you may wish to cross the Botswana border for a day-trip into Chobe National Park, where large herds of African elephant roam. Board your Chobe River cruise, watching herds of elephant and buffalo come to the edge of the river to drink. After lunch enjoy an afternoon game drive before returning to Victoria Falls for your last night in Zimbabwe. Day 10 - Victoria Falls - Depart Johannesburg With fond memories of animals, waterfalls and friendly locals fresh in your mind, your trip around southern Africa’s icons will come to an end today. You’ll tuck into breakfast, then transfer to Victoria Falls Airport for your included flight to Johannesburg, where your tour ends upon arrival. Please ensure your international flight home departs after 19:30. More Deals Enquire *Terms and Conditions Offer subject to availability at time of booking.
