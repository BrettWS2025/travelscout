We’ll meet at its capital, Palermo: a breath of intoxicating contrasts where locals greet you with a warm, welcoming smile. Gaze at monuments that have stood the test of time whilst lively markets with swirls of spicy scents line adjacent streets. This evening, we’ll come together for our first group dinner, sampling delicious local Sicilian cuisine. Salute! (D) Day 2: Selinunte Pull back the hotel curtains, your first morning in Sicily awaits. As birds chirp in the distance, ready yourself for a walking tour of the city. But this is no ordinary tour – it's filled with secrets, power and an elusive ruthlessness that evades law and order. We are, of course, talking about the Mafia, or specifically Palermo’s anti-Mafia movement – and the brave Sicilians who defended their home. With a visit to the house of anti-Mafia magistrate Paolo Borsellino and a local guide sharing tales that date back decades, you’ll learn the truth not shown on the big screen. Perched atop the Monte Caputo – overlooking the fertile valley of La Conca d’Oro – Monreale reigns with regal beauty. At its renowned cathedral, time will stop as we admire the Norman-Byzantine architecture and intricate mosaics. Afterwards, follow the scent of fresh tomatoes, melted cheese and baked swordfish – it's time to find lunch! Our final stop of the day is Selinunte – hailing from Magna Graecia, and home to our rustic accommodation, it’s the ideal place to put your feet up after an eventful day! (B) Day 3: Favara Awakening in the middle of an olive grove can only mean one thing: an olive oil tasting! As the sun warms your face and a gentle morning breeze tugs your t-shirt, settle at a hotel table with your friendly group and wait for the award-winning, golden liquid to be served. Tastebuds teased, we’ll alight the minicoach for our drive towards Agrigento. Along the way, your expert Tour Leader may opt to stop at a local spot or two – sharing their personal knowledge and passion for the island that holds a special place in their heart. And what awaits us in Agrigento? One of the most impressive collections of ancient Greek monuments in the world, the Valley of the Temples... A place where the mighty Gods and Goddesses descended to make their presence known in a time of blood, battle and prayer. Here, temples shine like gold when Helio, the ancient god of sun and light, angles the sun just right. Wander between ridged columns, touching stone that’s felt the air caress it over thousands of years. Favara is where we’ll rest tonight, after a group dinner filled with seasonal dishes and excited chatter about the days we’ve experienced so far. (B,D) Day 4: Ragusa Swap your sun hats for history caps this morning – the beating heart of Piazza Armerina calls: Villa Romana del Casale, located a stone’s throw from town. Among the ruins of this 4th-century palace lies a web of Roman mosaics – each one illustrating a different vision of the past. Discover tigers, horses, battles and other intricate creations – which will intrigue you most? Standing tall atop a hill between two deep valleys lies Ragusa, our home for the next two nights. Watch the sun kissing architecture as it begins to set behind distant hills. Breathe in natural fragrances such as sharp citrus groves and sweet jasmine blooms that mingle with the enticing aromas of fresh pasta, seafood and arancini cooked by locals. And seek trinkets to take home as a vibrant reminder of your journey spent with us. (B) Day 5: Ragusa Do you have a sweet tooth? If yes, you’ll be delighted by today’s experience. If not, we’re sure you’ll come around. It’s a chocolate tasting session in Modica, but that’s not all. Here, you’ll gain insight into a unique charity project where local people are hired to learn the chocolatier trade. From chocolate to cheese, our journey takes us to a local farm where buffaloes roam. We’ll meet the sturdy creatures who produce the milk and learn the secrets behind the famed provola ragusana cheese. Then, settle in for a buffalo mozzarella tasting, complete with a colourful platter of vegetables (and a sampling of the region’s wines – naturally!). Later, we’ll wind back to the spirited city of Ragusa. Here, the rest of the day is yours to explore! Wander through twisting alleyways – a glimpse of local life at every turn. Witness local families sharing a lengthy lunch where food never stops flowing. And settle in a piazza with a hearty dish of your own as the sky turns pink above. (B) Day 6 : Syracuse Sip your espresso and eat your brioche before finding your seat aboard our luxury minicoach this morning. We’re heading to Noto, a city that captures the power Baroque architecture exudes. This morning’s topic: almonds! As our local guide shares how the famed fruit is grown here – and have since Romans times – we'll stroll along paved paths, pass lively coffee shops and crane our necks before the Baroque-style Cathedral of St. Nicholas that stands proud. Keeping on theme of the gentle sweetness that is an almond, we’ll enjoy a tasting for our lunch, clinking glasses of almond milk, too – will this inspire you to introduce almond milk at home, we wonder? Prepare to slow the pace even more during our stay in Syracuse. Here, visitors and locals alike stroll along the waterfront as a gentle breeze swirls in the air, or pass by honey-coloured buildings, peeking inside open windows. We'll take a wander through the archaeological park with a local guide, admiring the Teatro Greco – a 5th-century theatre, and hear tales that entwine like tendrils around each monument. After, allow the scent of sweet and sour flavours lure you back to the town centre and discover your next Sicilian meal as the inky blue of night ascends. (B,L) Day 7 Today, the chief Greek city of ancient Sicily – which rivalled glorious Athens in the old empire – is yours for the taking. Where will this part of your journey take you? We have some suggestions! Feel the spirit of the ancient Greeks flow through you on a boat trip across the Ionian Sea and scour hidden caves for their secrets. See Sicilian stories come to life through a puppet show, where atmosphere, improvisation and humour collide. Descend to the underground labyrinth where the almost-forgotten Jewish community’s past lingers within its stone. Or lose yourself in the city’s winding streets where the hum of life welcomes you in a warm embrace. How you spend your day is your choice – but perhaps eating stimpirata or frittura di paranza like a local is on the cards today, and a little dolce far niente too! (B) Day 8: Etna Region Wave a fond arrivederci to Syracuse, our journey today will take our eyes skyward. Their focus: the slumbering giant called Mount Etna where Zeus imprisoned the giant Typhon beneath its immovable surface. We’ll stop at Rifugio Sapienza, the ideal spot to take in views of the mountain’s wild glory. Rake your eyes across extinct craters, cragged lines (where lava has stormed through in fiery rage) and its ominous peak. An opportunity to venture closer to Etna’s bold spirit is available via cable car – our only question, does the thrill of the mountain entice you forward? Our next stop: stretches of lush vineyards that billow with the cent of grapes at every stage of life, from youthful seeds to ripened prime. Rooted in land since the 18th century through ten generations, our setting for lunch and wine is as welcoming as it is traditional. After satisfying our stomachs, we’ll descend into the dimmed wine cellar where the past melts into the present. Later, we’ll make tracks towards our hotel which slumbers in the foothills of Etna, surrounded by finely cut grass and trees that rustle in the late afternoon breeze. Here, we’ll spend two nights – making full use of the spa facilities to relax! (B,L) Day 9: Etna Region As sunlight dances in your room, stretch your arms and ready yourself for another venture. This time, we’re visiting Taormina, a city founded in 400 BC. You’ll certainly feel like you’ve stepped into the past at its ancient Greek theatre, sitting at the top of a hill like a domineering god on their throne. Settle in the moment to imagine gladiators fighting to the death and dramatic performances entertaining thousands of people. It is still used for concerts to this day, but we’re sure no blood is spilled! We’ll wind back to town where free time is our friend for the remainder of the day. Stroll through Corso Umberto, Taormina’s main street, filled with the sounds of friends sharing gossip, wine sloshing into glasses at local restaurants, and shopping bags rustling as locals go about their daily life. And hunt down your favourite Sicilian snack one last time before you return home. After a day of exploring, we’ll settle into the hotel restaurant for our farewell dinner. Swap tales of your favourite days, the moments that wouldn’t be possible with anyone else, and the memories (and snacks!) that’ll be tucked in your heart for the rest of time. (B,D) Day 10: Catania It’s our final day, but first, we’ll have the opportunity to stretch our legs during a walking tour of Catania. Nestled at the foot of Mount Etna, the historic and scenic veins of this ancient port city have been shaped by its volcanic sibling. As our local guide shares influences passed through Greek, Roman, Arab, and Byzantine époques, spinning a tale of colour and magic, we’ll wander towards the city’s famous fish market. What awaits? Bartering in Italian so fast your head will become a tennis umpire’s, slaps of sounds as fishmongers work with dexterous fingers and variety like you’ve never seen. Before we part ways, there is one last sweet treat to devour! Huddled in the city lies a pâtisserie that has been passed from grandfather to the last daughter of the family, creating a family history spanning 50 years. Here, we’ll fill our very own cannoli – a classic Sicilian dessert that effortlessly mixes crunch and creaminess. Alongside our ricotta cheese-filled cannoli will be servings of granita, a semi-frozen dessert that shocks the senses. And with that, your journey with us comes to an end. We hope your Sicilian journey was as satisfying as our final sweet treat together! (B) Terms & Conditions Fares are in NZD per person, twin share. Professional service fees apply.
