A wonderfully warm and walkable city, Gothenburg was founded in 1621 and boasts a great selection of fantastic restaurants in its historic inner harbour area for dinner. (Overnight Gothenburg) Day 4: Oslo Following breakfast at your hotel, make your way to the station and board a direct train to Oslo for a two-night stay. Once you've checked in, take the rest of the day to start exploring the city at your own pace—whether that’s visiting a museum, strolling along the waterfront, or relaxing at a local café.

Here, transfer onto a bus which will take you up the winding bends of the Stalheimskleiva to a lookout point above the Stalheimsfossen and Sivlefossen waterfalls. You'll make a brief stop to admire the view before continuing to Voss, where you transfer to the station for your onward train journey to Bergen.

On arrival in Oslo, check in at your hotel for the last night of your holiday. If the weather is fine this evening, why not go to the waterfront area of Aker Brygge where there are many bars and restaurants overlooking the harbour. Alternatively, head to the Oslo Opera House, an amazing building constructed to resemble a glacier emerging from the water. The building is worth a visit, even if you don't go for a performance.
