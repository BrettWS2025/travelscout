Rental car or transfers not included. Walks are graded moderate to hard, advanced fitness and trekking skills required. Guests will need to be able to hike an average of 14km per day, for multiple days. A training guide will be provided by the team at 3 months prior to each walk departure. Guests must be comfortable with wearing a backpack with an average weight of 6kg. Itinerary Day 1 Meet your guides & fellow walkers at 7.00am for a prompt 7.30am departure at our private property. An adventurous day that sees you climb up the Mistake Mountain Range. The ecosystem is dry sclerophyll forest with incredible views of the valley below. The trail is rough and uphill for most of the day. We use the natural rock to help us climb in some areas known as ‘rock scrambling’. The 12km of trail is Grade 4 & 5. A highlight is the 16m rock ladder, which you’ll be safely harnessed to. You will cheer each other on as each group member makes it to the top. We aim to arrive at camp by approx. 3.30pm each day depending on conditions & the speed of the group. From here the afternoon is at your leisure ahead of your daily briefing in the lounge before a share style dinner at approximately 6:00pm. Your group will dine together at a set time each evening enjoying stories from the day. Day 2 Sunrise at Mt Mistake is a highlight of the trip. If it is forecast to be a clear morning, we highly recommend heading out to the escarpment with a warm drink in hand. Breakfast is served at 6.45am with tea and coffee available earlier. Your guides will provide you with your lunches and show you where to refill your water bottles before departing at 8am. Today’s Trail follows a former logging route once traversed by bullock and cart. We will start the day with a climb before entering Gondwana Rainforest for your first encounter of this natural wonder. The wide trail allows for walking side by side with moderate inclines and many flat sections. The trail is exposed in sections so in the warmer months we are sure to take plenty of water breaks. In the final section of the trail, we step deep into the rainforest on a Grade 5 track that takes us into camp. Arrive at camp and take a moment to enjoy your what you achieved today overlooking the natural amphitheatre. Enjoy the afternoon in your tree house style cabin. There are two wash pavilions and after a well-earned shower you are welcome to make your way to the lounge to relax. Sunset at the viewing deck is highly recommended with dinner being served at approximately 6pm. Day 3 Following our morning routine of breakfast, packing and gathering our gear we walk out at 8am. We start the day with a relatively flat warm up as we make our way up the access road enjoying the sounds of the rainforest birds as we go. This access track can sometimes get muddy so we may have to skirt our way around some puddles as we make our way past. As we descend into the valley, we become enveloped by rainforest.Half of today is on Grade 5 trail with our guides leading the way on the unmarked trails. We ascend down some rocky boulder sections that will require us to crouch down and go slowly. The pace is slower as we take care with our footing navigating the tree roots and rocks. Arrive at camp - formally a loggers camp you can view the old tin shack that once housed loggers ‘timber getters’ of the era. Relax for the afternoon and notice the differences in the environment and aesthetics of the camp. Gather in the lounge for your daily briefing ahead of dinner. Day 4 The birdlife is beautiful here particularly at dawn for the early risers. Following our morning routine of breakfast, packing and gathering our gear for the day, we walk out at 8am. We start the day with a heartwarming climb up the fire trail and past an old pine plantation. Once at the top we head deep into the rainforest on a Grade 5 trail. We come across some huge rainforest trees with buttresses six feet tall. Once again, the pace is slower as we all take care with our footing navigating the tree roots and rocky sections. Emerge from deep in the rainforest to climb up and over Bare Rock offering 360-degree views on a clear day. From here we join the public trails and will often pass fellow walkers, not many of whom will ever venture where you have just been. In the final section of the trail the modern world comes into earshot as we hear trucks carrying goods from the coast to the west. Vehicles will be waiting for you at the end of the trail ready to transfer you to Spicers Hidden Peaks Cabins. The drive is approximately 15 minutes to camp where you will be greeted and shown to your log cabin, each with it’s own en-suite. After you have rested and settled into camp meet around the fire pit to share stories and your favourite memories from the trip followed by our final dinner together. Day 5 On your final morning a BBQ farmhouse breakfast will be served at a leisurely 8am. Enjoy some free time before you say a fond farewell to your guides and fellow walkers at 10am. Those returning to Brisbane by transfer should arrange collection for 10am. You will depart the Scenic Rim Trail with lifelong memories and a renewed love of nature.
