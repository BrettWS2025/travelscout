Itinerary Day 1: Kruger National Park Departing Johannesburg at 06:30am we head into the world-famous Kruger National Park. We visit the northern part of the park and stay in the Letaba area of the reserve. We enjoy an afternoon game drive in our safari vehicle and hope to spot lion, elephant, rhino and other animals in this icon of wildlife conservation. Day 2: Kruger National Park This morning, we wake early and game drive north through the park to the Pafuri region. Northern Kruger is dominated by mopane veld and is the domain of large elephant bulls, wild dogs and lions. As we reach the Limpopo Valley the vegetation changes to forest and birdlife is prolific. We exit the park, late in the afternoon, and overnight at a community owned lodge just outside the Kruger. Day 3: Great Zimbabwe Entering Zimbabwe, we travel north to our overnight stop. The following morning, we visit the Great Zimbabwe Monuments on an informative walk with a local guide. These well-preserved ruins are some of the oldest and largest stone structures in Southern Africa and were built during the 11th to 14th centuries. Day 4-5: Matobo National Park Travelling via the city of Bulawayo we move on to the Matobo National Park and our chalets on the outskirts of the park. This afternoon we enjoy sundowners from the granite ridge overlooking the park. The following morning, we visit World’s View and the historical site of Cecil John Rhodes’ grave. Unusual rock formations are home to an array of ancient bushman paintings which we visit while on our game drive and walk. This area is also home to Zimbabwe’s rhino which we hope to see on our excursion in the national park. Day 6-7: Hwange National Park Hwange National Park is the largest Park in Zimbabwe occupying roughly 14 650 square kilometres and is famed for its large elephant population. Our chalets are in the game management area that borders the park, and we explore the park with our local guide, on a full day game drive on day 7 in an open 4WD game viewing vehicle. Day 8-9: Victoria Falls We enjoy a spectacular guided walk through tropical vegetation to the very edge of the “Mosi oa Tunya” or “the smoke that thunders” - Victoria Falls. You will have a free to relax of enjoy one of the many optional own expense activities on offer. Day 10: Chobe National Park Entering Botswana, we head to the town of Kasane and our accommodation on the banks of the Chobe River. The river flows lazily along the northern boundary of the Chobe National Park attracting some of the largest herds of elephant in Africa. A highlight of any trip to the Chobe is the afternoon game viewing cruise where we hope to see large herds of elephants and other wildlife as they quench their thirst at the end of the day. Day 11: Chobe National Park - Nata This morning, we venture into the Chobe National Park in an open 4WD in search of big cats and elephants. Afterwards we drive south through the Kasane Forest Reserve to the Nata area for our overnight stop. In the late afternoon we visit Nata Sanctuary for sunset and look out across the expanse of the Makgadikgadi Pans. Day 12-14: Okavango Delta We transfer into the delta by open 4WD game viewing vehicle. Our local guides will take us deep into the heart of the Okavango Delta on Mokoro (dugout canoes) to our pre-erected tented camp. The delta forms as rainwater from the Angolan highlands flows out over the flat Kalahari Desert sands, forming a delicate, green oasis for birds and wildlife. Our camp is on a remote island in this amazingly dynamic environment, and we enjoy bush walks, bird watching and swimming in the clear waters. Camping with our local guides we learn more about their lifestyle and culture. Returning to Maun in the afternoon of day 14 there is time for an optional scenic flight over the Okavango (own expense). Day 15: Goo Moremi Gorge Heading south from Maun, we cross the wide-open spaces of the Kalahari Desert. Along the route we might encounter small herds of zebra interspersed among cattle herds between remote villages. As we approach Goo-Moremi the Tswapong Hills rise above the horizon. Here endangered Cape Vultures nest on the gorge cliffs above the ancestral waterfalls in the protected conservation area of Goo-Moremi Gorge. Time permitting, we take an afternoon guided walk to stretch our legs. Day 16: Johannesburg - Tour Ends Crossing back into South Africa, we make our way to Johannesburg where we first drop off at Johannesburg’s International Airport at approximately 5pm and then at our departure hotel by around 6pm.
