There is more than enough variety in Tokyo to occupy a lifetime, but your visit may in include such highlights as the Imperial Palace and Gardens, a rickshaw ride through the historic Asakusa district and its Sensoji Temple, the huge National Museum, architectural oddities such as the Skytree Tower and the Tokyo Dome entertainment complex, or the shopping and entertainment meccas of Ginza, Roppongi or the dazzling electronics emporia of Akihabara. Your evening could include classical entertainment such as a kabuki performance, or the astonishing quirkiness of the teenaged fashion, cosplay and anime-fans along Takeshita Dori in Shinjuku. Day 2: At Sea Experience all your ship has to offer onboard. Day 3 & 4: Kobe, Japan Once the busiest port in Japan, this attractive city was devastated by an earthquake in 1995 and even after rebuilding never regained its maritime dominance. Nevertheless, its ultra-modern Harborland, crowned by the Kobe Port Tower offers a warm welcome to the Kansai district of Japan. Kansai is ruled by a trio of Japan’s most important cities: Kobe, Osaka and Kyoto. One of the first cities in Japan opened to trade, Kobe has a cosmopolitan air that includes a venerable Chinatown and a section of 19th-Century Western-style buildings in the Kitano neighborhood. The city’s history began in the 3rd-Century with construction of the Ikuta Shrine. Many visitors ascend looming Mt. Rokko via the Shinkobe Ropeway, for panoramic views over the city and the glass-domed Nunobiki Herb Garden on the slopes. The Arima Onsen hot springs right in Kobe is one of Japan, most famous spas. Massive Osaka is the largest of the trio of cities, with over 2.5 million people and attractions of its own including a reconstructed castle, the impressive Kaikuyan Aquarium and the odd-ball Momofuku Ando Instant Ramen Museum commemorating the man who invented the ubiquitous cup-of-noodles. The richest repository of Japanese culture, however, is centered in Kyoto, where a UNESCO World Heritage Site encompasses no fewer than 17 structures as the Historic Monuments of Ancient Kyoto. Castles, gardens, temples and other treasures abound, and make a compelling reason for visitors to make the pilgrimage from Kobe for the day. Day 5: At Sea Experience all your ship has to offer. Day 6: Hiroshima, Japan Hiroshima means “wide island” in Japanese. The city was established in the 16th Century on Japan’s largest island, Honshu, and grew into an important shipping center and prefecture capital, boasting a fine castle. Although it was an important city in Japan throughout the imperial period, its reputation in the greater world was burned into history when it became to target of the first atomic bombing of a civilian target in August of 1945. The United States airplane Enola Gay dropped a nuclear device nicknamed “Little Boy” on the city that morning, obliterating everything within a two-kilometer radius and directly killing 80,000 people. Approximately 70 percent of Hiroshima’s buildings were destroyed. Within a year, injury and radiation illness had killed an additional 90, 000 to 116,000 citizens. The attacks on Hiroshima and nearby Nagasaki quickly led to the surrender of Japan and effectively precipitated the end of World War II in Asia. Within a few years, Hiroshima had begun to rebuild, and the city became the focus of an international movement to eliminate nuclear weapons from future wars. Relics of its past such as the impressive Hiroshima Castle and the tranquil Shukkeien Garden were rebuilt, and the city undertook the construction of a Memorial Peace Park, which today attracts visitors from around the world. The park, which holds a museum and a memorial “Atomic Dome” constructed on the closest remaining building to the blast site, is a moving and impactful place of pilgrimage in this re-born City of Peace. One notable feature is a colorful memorial to Sadako Sasaki, a young woman whose dying wishes for world peace were recounted in the story A Thousand Paper Cranes. Day 7: Scenic Cruising Kanmon Strait Kanmon Straits is a narrow channel of water that separates Honshu and Kyushu, two of Japan's main islands, while connecting the Sea of Japan with the Inland Sea. The strait has long played an important role in Japanese maritime history; the Shimonoseki Campaign — a series of military engagements with the U.S. and other navies that took place here in the 1860s — ended Japanese feudal rule over the region, thus opening Japan to the West and transforming it into an international trading hub. Twin 19th-centry lighthouses mark the port cities that face each other across the channel: Moji, Kyushu and Shimoneseki on Honshu, where you can still see cannons used during the naval campaign. Some 700 ships pass through Kanmon Straits on a daily basis; underground tunnels allow both cars and pedestrians to walk between the two ports. Japan’s largest fireworks display takes place over the strait every August, drawing more than a million sky gazers to watch the spectacular. Day 8: Fukuoka (Hakata), Japan Located on the northern tip of Japan’s Kyushu Island, Hakata harbor’s location close to the Asian mainland made it an important port from very ancient times, serving the early administrative center at Dazaifu near by. In the 13th century, the Mongol Kublai Khan tried twice to subdue the city, but his attacks were both foiled by typhoons, which earned the last one the name Kamikaze, meaning “Divine Wind.” In the late 19th century, Hakata and the nearby samurai city of Fukuoka were merged. Today Fukuoka is a large, modern and eminently livable city that still benefits from its proximity to Korea and other “Asian Tiger” economies. Attractions for visitors include a park surrounding the ruins of the samurai Fukuoka Castle; the Shokufuji Temple, Japan’s first Zen temple; and the Japanese Garden and Gokoku Shrine in Ohori Park. The Genko Historical Museum holds displays of Japanese and Mongol armor from the period of the Mongol invasions. Modern highlights include the shopping and entertainment complex of Canal City and the waterfront Momochi Seaside Park development. Near by, the old 7th Century city of Dazaifu offers the Dazaifu Tenmangu Shrine with 6,000 flowering plum trees, the tranquil Komyozenji Temple with a lovely Zen garden, and the impressive, modern Kyushu National Museum. Day 9: Busan (Pusan), South Korea Home to approximately 3.4 million people, Busan is a fast-moving coastal metropolis that guarantees you’ll never have the same experience twice. History enthusiasts will find themselves captivated by the stunning historical treasures of Beomeosa Temple, a serene oasis nestled within the city, with a rich heritage that dates back over 1,300 years. No trip is complete without strolling through Yongdusan Park to take in panoramic views while marveling at the iconic Busan Tower, a symbol of the city's aspirations and dynamism. Busan's culinary scene is a highlight of any visit. Savor the city's diverse gastronomy by exploring its bustling markets like Jagalchi Fish Market, where you can feast on freshly caught seafood, and indulge in delectable Korean street food. The city's natural beauty is another compelling reason to visit, with its pristine beaches like Haeundae Beach offering a tranquil escape by the sea. For those seeking a glimpse of Busan's ecological diversity, Dongbaek Island's ecological park features coastal walks and panoramic ocean views. Whether you’re drawn to studying the city's past and or its constant evolution, this destination appeals to a wide range of interests and tastes. Day 10: Nagasaki, Japan Nagasaki’s fine natural harbor on Kyushu island was mostly of local interest until Portuguese explorers landed there in 1543. It quickly flourished as a trading center for European and Asian merchants, which continued throughout its history. It also developed into an important industrial center. Because of its open status, the city harbored a significant Christian community, as well as a bustling Chinatown. During World War II, Nagasaki’s concentration of military and industrial sites made it a target of repeated Allied bombing raids, culminating in a nuclear bombing on August 9, 1945, the second, and to date the last use of a nuclear weapon in war. As in Hiroshima a few days before, the devastation from the aerial explosion of the “Fat Man” plutonium bomb was horrific. An area of over 2.5 square miles was flattened, and about 80,000 people were killed directly, with an equal number suffering injuries. Now rebuilt, and with a thriving industrial and shipbuilding economy, Nagasaki still attracts visitors with the relics of its history up to and including the atomic bombing. Day 11: Kagoshima, Japan Tucked into a deep-cut bay at the southern end of Kyushu Island, this port has been compared to Naples in Italy, because it is also dominated by views of an active stratovolcano, Sakurajima. Enjoy its magnificence from the Shiroyama Observatory, or from the tranquil Edo-period Senganen Japanese Garden. Ishibashi Park has three Edo-era stone bridges, of five originally built at the end of the 19th century. Near the port is the impressive Kagoshima Aquarium, with seven floors of displays including the massive Kuroshio Tank maintaining a current that sustains large specimens including a whale shark. Day 12: Hososhima (Miyazaki), Japan Hososhima is a tranquil retreat where natural beauty and timeless charm create a truly enchanting escape. This idyllic coastal haven beckons with its serene ambiance, where ancient landscapes meet the allure of a picturesque seaside setting. Stroll through Hososhima’s charming streets and discover a seamless blend of traditional architecture and lush, tranquil parks, offering a serene and immersive cultural experience. Whether you’re captivated by the gentle waves of the surf or simply savoring the breathtaking vistas from cliff-top viewpoints, Hososhima promises an unforgettable journey into Japan’s rich heritage and natural splendour. Day 13: At Sea Experience all your ship has to offer. Day 14: Toba, Japan Toba, Japan, is a serene coastal town in Mie Prefecture known for its stunning bay views, rich maritime history, and traditional pearl cultivation. It’s the birthplace of Mikimoto Pearls, where visitors can learn about the art of pearl diving and even watch demonstrations by ama—Japan’s famous female free divers. With its relaxed seaside charm, fresh seafood, and cultural landmarks like the Toba Aquarium and Mikimoto Pearl Island, Toba offers a peaceful yet enriching glimpse into Japan’s coastal heritage. Day 15: Shimizu, Japan A busy port located on the Suruga Bay, Shimizu is renowned for the surrounding views of Mt. Fuji. One of the most famous is from Miho no Matsubara, a shoreline lined with groves of lovely pine trees that is a UNESCO Cultural Heritage Site. One tree, said to be over 650 years old, plays a part in a popular folkloric myth. On clear days, the snow-capped cone can also be viewed from the heights of the Nihondaira Plateau overlooking the city and the bay. Near the port, the four-story S Pulse Dream Plaza shopping mall boasts a museum dedicated to sushi! Day 16: Tokyo, Japan Your cruise ends in Tokyo, Japan’s cutting-edge capital, the world’s largest city famed for its blazing neon, techno-gadgets, and serious fashion sense. Get a glimpse into Tokyo’s glorious past while strolling the Imperial Palace gardens, or take a rickshaw ride through the Asakusa district with its ancient Sensoji Temple and colorful atmosphere that echoes Old Edo. Wander the Tsukiji Market — aka, “Tokyo’s Kitchen” — the world’s largest fish and seafood market, and raise a glass of rice lager at the Philippe Starck-designed Asahi Beer Hall located near the 2,080-foot-high Skytree, the world’s tallest tower. You can shop for fashion-forward trends in Shibuya before heading to the rooftop garden that crowns Shibuya Scramble Square for outstanding views of Mount Fuji. If you think Tokyo buzzes by day, wait until you see it at night — so take advantage of a late-evening departure to soak in all of Shinjuku’s razzle dazzle, explore Akihabara’s gadget shops and gaming arcades, or join in Japan’s favorite pastime at one of Roppongi’s karaoke bars.
