Itinerary Day 1: Hossa National Park Tervetuloa! Welcome to Rovaniemi, Finland – the capital of Lapland and the joining point for your winter family adventure. At 1pm your Intrepid leader will greet you in the lobby of Hotel Aakenus to conduct a short welcome meeting. It is very important to be on time for this meeting and to have eaten lunch prior to the meeting as you will begin the drive to your lodge at Hossa National Park immediately after. On the way to Hossa you will stop at a local reindeer farm to meet these amazing creatures and learn a little about life in Lapland from a local family. In the late afternoon you will arrive to your accommodation tucked away in the wintery woodland landscape and settle into your rooms. Dinner is included this evening and you will be able to toast to the magical adventure that lies ahead. Day 2: Hossa Wake up to breakfast this morning and take in the beautful surroundings of Hossa National Park, located in the Kainuu region of Finland. Hossa translates to 'a distant place' in the Sami language (Huossa), and with its many lakes, rivers and canyons, this truly is a place like no other. Hossa will be your home for the next few days, so you will plenty of time to sit back, soak in the scenery and if you're lucky, witness the northern lights dancing above in the night sky. If your kids are the more adventurous type there will be optional activities on offer where they can try out snowshoeing or test their balance with some Nordic skiing. The adventure is yours to make your own. Day 3: Hossa Make sure you rug up for today’s adventure, as you head into the wild taiga on dog sleds! In the morning, meet your guides and dogs for an introduction to basic mushing techniques. Then, two per sled, you’ll head off across beautiful white lakes and into the forest. These incredible huskies are doing what they love most – making a lot of noise before rushing along sprawling trails. After, the young ones might get to give the dogs a pet and a cuddle – just be sure to ask the sledmaster first! Return to your accommodation in time for lunch, then the rest of the day is yours to enjoy as you like. Day 4: Hossa Get a taste of the Lapland lifestyle today as the family spends time with a local trapper. You’ll learn the art of the trapper lifestyle and the essential skills the local people need to know in order to survive and move around this pristine and remote region. The kids will feel like true adventurers as they follow tracks in the snow, identify flora and fauna and even build an igloo! Return to your accommodation in the evening, making sure to keep an eye out for any hint of the Northern Lights. Day 5: Rovaniemi This morning, it’s time to say goodbye to your home in the Finnish wilderness and make the journey back to Rovaniemi where you will arrive around midday (12pm). Rovaniemi is full of culture, museums, stunning landscapes and of course the home of Santa Claus himself. If you and your family would like to spend time exploring the town, speak to your booking agent who can assist with helping you to extend your stay.
