You’ll meet your crew in the afternoon, and in a super central location too. Following on from some free time to explore the Insadong Hanok village, we’ll regroup for some famous Korean fried chicken (and beer too if you like – you’re on vacation after all). Day 2 - Seoul Our Seoul City tour begins bright and early today with a visit to the traditional Gyeongbokgung Palace. To cap off the experience, we’ll also have the chance to dress in traditional Hanbok dress. Oh, and is it possible to visit South Korea without seeing Gangnam? Nope. That’s why we’ll make a pit-stop there. Next, we’ll head to Seongsu – one of the best up and coming districts of Seoul – to check out the shops, cafes and treat ourselves to some lunch. If the weather is kind tonight, we’ll head out to Yeouido Hangang Park for a riverside picnic. AKA vibes, tunes and convenience store ramen. Day 3 - Seoul and DMZ This morning we’ll head to the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), the strip of land which separates North and South Korea. With a local guide on hand to answer our questions, we’ll see the 3rd Infiltration Tunnel, and the Dora Observatory (where, if it’s sunny, you’ll be able to see all the way into North Korea) and then the Unification Village. After a rather sobering morning outing, we’ll head back to Seoul where you'll be free to explore this evening. Day 4 - Seoul to Busan Today we’ll step away from the historic sites and hustle and bustle of Seoul and head off to Busan on a high-speed train (travellin’ like locals, baby)! With a rich history, Busan is now known for its arty vibes, sumptuous street food and colourful buildings… so have your cameras at the ready. Tonight you’ll have a free evening to chill out with your Contiki crew. (Karaoke anyone?) Day 5 - Busan Wakey wakey folks, we have a whole day to explore the beauty of Busan (the world’s 5th largest port). Home to Haeundae, this is one of South Korea’s best beach spots – don’t miss those coastal walks and sublime city views. Any K-drama fans in the house? Talk to your Trip Manager about filming locations nearby from your favourite shows. Then tonight we’ll get together to enjoy Busan by night on a private yacht – complete with snacks, drinks and big tunes. Day 6 - Busan to Jeonju Today we’ll take a turn for the traditional with a visit to Jeonju – a UNESCO listed city recognised for its Hanok heritage. After checking out spots from BTS’ music videos and sampling candy made famous from ‘Squid Game’, we’ll enjoy a traditional bibimbap lunch. This afternoon, you’ll have plenty of time to explore the traditional village, checking out the multiple crafts and cuisines on display. We’ll have time to learn about traditional Korean crafts and culture, and then tonight we’ll bed down at a local guest house and discover Korean hospitality at its finest. Day 7 - Jeonju to Seoul - Hongdae Today we're heading back to where it started - Seoul. We’ll stay in Hongdae – one of the city’s best up and coming areas, home to some cool shops, eateries and edgy nightlife. Today, we’ll visit a local Buddhist temple to take part in some traditional Buddhist practices, including meditative art and tea making. Don't pass up the opportunity to catch a stray at one of Korea's famous baseball games. Day 8 - Seoul - Hongdae On our final full day in Seoul, we won’t waste any time hangin’ around. After learning some sick moves at our optional dance class, you’ll have the chance to unleash your inner K-Pop star when we make our very own music video at HIKR Ground. Afterwards, you’ll have the chance to shop for K-Beauty must-haves and traditional Korean cooking staples. Tonight, we’ll sign off with a farewell dinner… and it won’t just be any old farewell dinner. Korean BBQ? You bet. Day 9 - End Seoul - Hongdae And with that, our South Korea trip is complete. We’ll depart this morning after breakfast. Culturally fulfilled? Yep. Better and more well rounded? Of course. Already planning the next one? Absolutely.
