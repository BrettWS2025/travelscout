Transfer to the port for embarkation. You will have time to settle into your cabin before our important briefings begin. Enjoy the thrill of departure as we 'throw the lines' and set sail for Raja Ampat. Meet your Expedition Team and crew at the Captain's Welcome Dinner. Day 3-6: Raja Ampat, the epicentre of the Coral Triangle Located in the ‘Coral Triangle,’ Raja Ampat archipelago has been described as a marine ‘species factory,’ and a Mission Blue Hope Spot. Believed to contain the most biodiverse marine habitat on the planet, the waters surrounding Raja Ampat are home to 600 species of hard coral and 1,500 types of fish – more than anywhere else in the world – which makes for exceptional diving and snorkelling experience. We plan to spend four days exploring the coral reefs and shoals, limestone formations and rainforests of this hidden gem. Some of the islands we plan to explore include Wayag, Waigeo, Wofoh Island and Misool Marine Reserve, another Mission Blue Hope Spot. Waigeo, the largest island in the Raja Ampat archipelago, is a birder’s dream. Its rugged coastline, framed by towering cliffs, gives way to a vast, largely unexplored interior. This dense jungle is home to an incredible array of wildlife, including the iconic Wilson’s Bird-of-Paradise and the Red Bird-of-Paradise. Opossums, snakes, tortoises, and monitor lizards also thrive in this pristine environment. Our early morning birding expedition takes us through diverse habitats, from regenerating to primary forest. This rich ecosystem supports a thriving bird population, with a chance to spot a variety of species, including hornbills, parrots, and pigeons as they emerge from their roosts. We’ll be on the lookout for elusive nocturnal creatures like the Papuan Boobook owl, Frogmouth, and Large-tailed Nightjar. Wayag Island is a quintessential postcard image of paradise. Its iconic mushroom-shaped limestone formations, rising dramatically from emerald waters, are a photographer’s dream. This World Heritage-listed island offers a multitude of activities for every adventurer. Explore the stunning Wayag Lagoon by Zodiac, surrounded by lush vegetation and exotic birdlife. Discover hidden white-sand beaches and the labyrinth of limestone karst islands, adorned with vibrant orchids and pitcher plants. For the adventurous, the challenging climb to the summit of Mount Pindito is rewarded with breathtaking panoramic views. Snorkelers and divers will be captivated by the underwater world, teeming with colourful fish and pristine coral reefs. Kayakers can paddle through the enchanting lagoon, surrounded by the island’s breathtaking beauty. Straddling the equator, Wofoh Island is a jewel in the heart of Raja Ampat. Two idyllic islands connected by a vibrant coral reef create a stunning natural haven. Lush vegetation, pristine beaches, and a thriving underwater world make this a tropical paradise. Immerse yourself in the crystal-clear waters, teeming with colourful marine life and surrounded by breathtaking scenery. Explore the island's pristine beaches, surrounded by dense coastal forests. Discover hidden coves and lagoons, perfect for snorkelling, diving, or simply relaxing. Misool, a pristine corner of Raja Ampat, is renowned for its breathtaking natural beauty and extraordinary marine biodiversity. Established in 2005, the Misool Marine Reserve safeguards a vast 300,000-acre expanse, protecting it from destructive fishing practices. This pioneering conservation effort has yielded remarkable results. A scientific study between 2007 and 2013 revealed a staggering 250% increase in fish biomass within the reserve, with some areas experiencing a phenomenal 600% recovery. This extraordinary transformation underscores the power of effective marine conservation. Beyond its ecological significance, Misool offers unparalleled opportunities for exploration and adventure. Relax in the crystal-clear waters, teeming with vibrant coral reefs and diverse marine life. Hike to the summit of Dafalen Peak for breathtaking panoramic views or discover the island's rich cultural heritage through ancient rock art sites. Subject to change due to pending regulatory and permitting approvals. Day 7-10: The Moluccas - the Spice Islands The Moluccas, or Spice Islands, are an archipelago of breathtaking beauty and rich history. Nestled in eastern Indonesia, these islands have captivated explorers and traders for centuries. Renowned for their production of precious spices like nutmeg and cloves, they once ignited a fierce competition among European powers. Beyond their historical significance, the Moluccas offer a diverse landscape of volcanic peaks, pristine beaches, and lush rainforests. From the bustling city of Banda Neira to the secluded islands of Banda Sea, this archipelago promises an unforgettable adventure for those seeking natural wonders, cultural immersion, and a taste of the exotic. We plan to visit Seram, the largest island in the Maluku province. Revered by locals as ‘Nusa Ina’, or Mother Island, it is believed to be the ancestral home of Central Maluku’s people. Nestled at the foot of towering limestone cliffs on Seram’s northern coast is the ancient village of Sawai. Said to predate the arrival of European explorers, Sawai is one of the region’s oldest settlements. Perched on stilts above the clear tropical waters of the Ceram Sea, the village offers a unique glimpse into a bygone era. For over four centuries, Banda Neira held a coveted position as the global epicentre of the nutmeg trade. This small island, once the focus of intense colonial rivalry, offers a captivating glimpse into a bygone era. Join a guided walking tour to uncover the island's rich history. Explore the ruins of Dutch and Portuguese forts, silent sentinels of a time when empires clashed over this precious spice. Stand in the footsteps of Christopher Cole, the British captain who liberated the Bandanese from the oppressive Dutch regime. Beyond its historical significance, Banda Neira boasts a unique charm. Wander through its quaint streets, lined with colonial-era buildings, and experience the warm hospitality of its people. Soak up in the island's vibrant culture and relax on pristine beaches. Banda Neira is more than just a historical site; it's a journey back in time and a chance to experience the heart of Indonesia's spice trade heritage. Subject to change due to pending regulatory and permitting approvals. Day 11: Boo Islands Tucked away in the far reaches of Raja Ampat, the Boo Islands are a secluded archipelago offering an unparalleled underwater adventure. These pristine islands, shielded from the crowds, promise a truly immersive experience for the intrepid expeditioner. Beneath the crystal-clear waters surrounding the smaller Boo Island lies a hidden lagoon, a secluded aquatic oasis teeming with exotic marine life. This untouched ecosystem is a diver’s dream, boasting a gentle slope that descends into a vibrant underwater world. Here, the delicate balance of nature is on full display, as a complex food chain unfolds before your eyes. From apex predators like sharks and groupers to the colourful Napoleon wrasse, the Boo Islands offer a front-row seat to the ocean’s intricate web of life. Renowned for their exceptional marine biodiversity, the Boo Islands are a testament to the raw beauty of Raja Ampat. As you explore these underwater wonders, you'll encounter a kaleidoscope of corals, fish species, and other aquatic creatures. Subject to change due to pending regulatory and permitting approvals. Day 12: Aljui Bay & Penemu Island, Raja Ampat Aljuy Island, a secluded bay on Waigeo, offers a unique blend of stunning scenery and exceptional marine life. This sheltered haven is renowned for its vibrant coral gardens, teeming with a diverse array of underwater creatures. Spend your morning exploring the bay’s pristine beaches and snorkelling in crystal-clear waters. Discover a thriving underwater ecosystem, home to an abundance of colourful fish, intricate coral formations, and fascinating marine life. For the adventurous, a leisurely cruise up the channel offers opportunities for birdwatching and exploring the bay’s hidden coves. In the afternoon, venture to the iconic Piaynemo Peak, part of the Fam Islands. Hike to the summit for breathtaking panoramic views of the surrounding islands and lagoons. Afterward, snorkel or kayak in the crystal-clear waters, surrounded by lush limestone formations. Aljuy and Piaynemo offer an unforgettable experience for nature lovers and adventure seekers alike. Subject to change due to pending regulatory and permitting approvals. Day 13: Disembark in Sorong During the early morning, we cruise back into Sorong. Farewell your Expedition Team upon disembarkation and transfer to the airport for our charter flight back to Denpasar, Bali.

Frequently Asked Questions Planning your cruise How do I choose which type of cruise is right for me There are three main types of cruising Ocean Cruises There is a wide range of itineraries, cruise lines and cruise ships to choose from for those seeking an ocean experience, or an exciting adventure across many countries. Ocean cruising is an amazing holiday where everything you could possibly need is within easy reach. River Cruises A leisurely cruise along the world’s waterways is a relaxing, and luxurious, way to travel. Whether you’re navigating across Europe or cruising Southeast Asia’s Mekong River, each new day on a river cruise brings a new experience. Luxury Cruises Luxury beyond belief. Soak up Michelin-star fine dining restaurants, butler service, and luxurious suites. Luxury cruising appeals to those travellers demanding an unparalleled, all-inclusive travel experience away from the hustle and bustle of the large crowds What types of cruises are there? There are cruises tailored to every type of traveller ie; adults only, couples, families, retirees, singles, large groups etc. Depending on the cruise line will depend on the type of cruise available and what is best suited to the experience you want. Most offer a full range of activities and facilities to participate in as a family. Kids clubs are also offered in some ships and are focused on keeping children entertained. Be prepared, some are more “kid-friendly” than others -always check with your HOT travel consultant Many cruise lines have adults only areas, and some are even fully adults only cruise ships. The larger the ship, the more space you will have. If you are looking for something a little smaller and more intimate, your cruising specialist will help you find that. Can I go on a cruise if I’m travelling alone? Yes - taking a cruise is a great way to relax and see the world at your own pace. A cruise is a fun and safe environment to meet other people, or just soak up the experience solo. Ask your cruise consultant about what’s best for solo travel and find out about the special add on rates for single occupancy of double staterooms. Should I check in before I go YES - we highly recommend checking in online ahead of time. While the process differs between cruise lines, you will usually need to create an account and enter your personal and booking details. It’s a must to do this in advance as you will be provided with a lot of important information to ensure you are fully prepared. This takes the stress out of the boarding process. You may be offered a choice of a few different boarding times, although some cruise lines do pre-allocate this for you. Your check in process will also outline when your bags are likely to be available once you are on board. This is important as it may not be immediately so you might want to reconsider what you take as carry-on so you have some essentials on hand What happens when I embark Like all travel, ensure you arrive at your embarkation port on time (preferably a little earlier) for your allocated boarding time. Make sure you have your boarding passes printed, your luggage tags securely attached to your bags and your passport on hand ready to go. Look out for your designated terminal, drop off your bags, then make your way through the security process. This is very similar to an airport, with metal detectors and x-rays for smaller carry-on bags. Once through security, you will approach the check-in counter, where you will have your photo taken and receive your onboard card, which will serve as your cabin key, onboard payment method and onboard ID. Your luggage will be delivered to your cabin during embarkation. Is cruising expensive? Like all travel, the cost is dependent on a lot of factors – things like the length of cruise, destination(s), the type of cruise line or room type. But because there is so much variety, there will be a cruise to suit everyone's budget. It can work out to be great value for money compared to a regular fly/stay holiday. Will I get seasickness? Most modern cruise ships have stabilizers in place to ensure passenger comfort. Plus, cruise ships will alter their routes in advance to avoid any adverse weather patterns and storms etc. But if you are prone to motion sickness, you could find yourself getting seasick on your cruise holiday. You could try natural remedies or over-the-counter prescribed medicines to counter motion sickness. Do I need a passport or visa to cruise You will require a passport to cruise internationally. Some close to home domestic sailings will only require a valid driver’s license. It is always recommended to have a valid passport whilst cruising and is your responsibility to ensure you have the applicable photo identification. Some countries do require you to obtain a visa in advance if you wish to disembark the ship in port. You will need to check the visa requirements for the countries visited on your cruise itinerary. Countries such as China, Russia, India, Canada and the USA require all New Zealand passport holders to obtain a visa. Always check with your HOT travel consultant and they will direct you to the right information. Will I save money if I book at the last minute or early? We recommend that if you are looking for a great deal book your cruise early. Some cruise lines offer great incentives for the early booking travellers. Thery could be things like complimentary room category upgrades, bonuses and discounted prices. Some even do airline flight credits! But these deals are normally for a limited time and will not last. Join our HOT cruise newsletter / email database, and we will let you know when there are offers or special deals available. Cruise pricing, like most things, reflects supply and demand. The more demand there is for a particular cruise the higher the price will be. Demand could be determined by factors such as the destination, seasons & duration of the cruise holiday. Like anything, waiting till the last minute does involve risk. If you wait, your cruise may have sold out. Then there is also the possibility of getting the cruise but in a room category that you don’t want. Our expert advice is - book early! Onboard your cruise Is there a dress code on board It will depend on what cruise line you are sailing with. As a rule, casual dress is accepted during the day, with smart casual or formal attire being required at night. Most cruise lines do not accept caps, jandals, bare feet, swimwear or sleepwear in formal dining venues. Some cruise lines enforce a stricter dress code, with men required to wear jackets and women cocktail attire at dinner. If you do not comply with your cruise line’s dress code, you may be asked to leave a particular venue. Make sure you check with your HOT travel consultant - you don’t want to get caught out Do cruise ships cater for passengers with accessibility requirement? Yes, most cruise lines have accessibility assistance in place for passengers with disabilities. Cruise ships typically offer a range of wheelchair-accessible cabins, however, the number of these may be limited. You must advise at time of booking – make sure you speak to your HOT travel consultant and outline any requirements for you or your travelling companions Some ocean ships can be large, which at times can be difficult for passengers with mobility problems to navigate. To make things easier, on some cruise ships you can rent a scooter or wheelchair for the duration of your cruise. Always check in advance with your HOT travel consultant Can I smoke onboard a cruise ship? All cabins and public areas onboard cruise ships are strictly non-smoking / vaping. You can, smoke/ vape in the ship’s designated smoking zones only If in doubt, ask the staff onboard your ship. Are my valuables safe on board? If you bring valuables with you, they are best to be kept in your in-room safe. We also recommend you keep your passport, and any important documents locked in the your safe also. Are gratuities or tips included? This depends on the cruise. Your cruise consultant will outline this as part of the booking process. Some holidays include gratuities in the total price, whilst others might require you to pay once you are onboard. How much luggage can I bring on the cruise? Cruise lines are not generally concerned about how much luggage you bring onboard, so there are largely no luggage restrictions on cruise ships. But be aware, some staterooms have limited closet space! But remember, if you are travelling by air etc to your departure port, all airlines have weight and ‘number of bag’ restrictions. Don’t get caught out – make sure you check the details carefully and be aware of any restrictions. Airlines do charge for oversize or excess baggage. Be prepared, check the restrictions with your travel consultant or the airline carrier directly before you book your flights. Should I book shore excursions or do my own sightseeing? Talk to your HOT travel consultant, it depends on what you want to do. You have options – you can do the shore activities arranged directly by the ship, as the quality and service offered is guaranteed. A bonus, if the tour is delayed the ship will wait for you before it sets sail again. You can, however, book shore excursions, whilst on board, or in advance if you want a more structured adventure. Doing your own local sightseeing can be exciting, however you’ll have to pay close attention to time as the ship will not wait for you if you are running late. What currency is used onboard? This varies depending on cruise line and destination. You can almost guarantee that the currency on most cruise lines will not be in NZD. Ships based in Australia will usually have AUD onboard. Ships that cruise in a variety of destinations will have a currency to reflect their company's ownership, which could be currencies such as USD or Euro. Make sure you ask your HOT travel consultant in advance, so you are prepared. What if I require a special diet? If you have special dietary requirements, you should advise your HOT travel consultant at time of booking. If you do have special requirements, make sure you arrange your meals in advance. However, if you do forget, you can arrange it onboard. What room type should I book? A lot of first-time cruisers choose an inside room (internal without a window) mainly due to the cost. However, it is normally only a small difference per day to upgrade to an oceanview room (with a view). Or investigate an upgrade to a balcony/veranda room which offers floor to ceiling windows that open to allow the fresh ocean air in. Check with your HOT travel consultant Can I take visitors on board? Think of a cruise ship like an airplane. No you can’t. Due to immigration and security reasons only registered guests are permitted onboard at all times. Is there babysitting on board? Babysitting is available at extra cost on some ships. Many cruise lines will offer popular kids club facilities onboard, and some cater better than others. But if you are on a cruise that is targeted at families will be spoilt for choice for ways to entertain the whole family Is there WiFI and mobile reception? Yes you can. Most ships offer Wi-Fi throughout the ship, whilst some only offer in designated areas. Most cruise ships have internet cafes on board. Charges do apply for the use of broadband & because it is based on satellite Phone Reception is generally only available in ports. Some cruise lines have agreements with land-based phone service companies. If you chose to use this service, you will be paying international roaming rates for these calls. Find out before you go – your HOT travel consultant can help How do I pay for on board expenses? Just like many hotels, an onboard account will be set up for you prior to departure. This means all your onboard purchases can be charged to this account. Payment will be made at the end of the cruise. Are there laundry services on board? Laundry and cleaning services are always available. It’s either self-service laundry facilities or a professional laundry service. You will find washing machines, dryers, ironing boards, irons and detergent on board. Self-service washing machines & dryers generally tend to be coin operated. Can I bring alcohol onboard the ship? You are not allowed to bring alcohol onboard the ships. Duty free and personal alcohol purchased onshore will be collected upon your check in and can be collected on the last day of your cruise. Any Duty- and Tax-Free alcohol purchased on the ship will be held for safekeeping and can be collected on the last day of the cruise. Not to worry - cruise lines largely offer drink packages so you can purchase drinks onboard. If not, your drinks can be charged to your cruise card. General cruise questions Can I place a deposit for a cruise booking? At time of booking you can choose to pay for the cruise in full or pay the minimum per person deposit amount. When do I need to pay for my cruise in full? If you have chosen to pay a deposit only, your full payment deadline will be determined by the cruise you book, so please check your Invoice for the final payment due date. What is included in the price of a cruise? Cruise holidays are one of the most value for money holidays you could go on. Your transportation, accommodation and main meals are included whilst onboard. Selected activities and entertainment are also included in the price. There are some additional activities that you may have to pay separately for, like special restaurants & shows. Ask your HOT travel consultant for a full list of inclusions and added extras you can pay for separately Do I need travel insurance? YES – we absolutely recommend that you take out comprehensive travel insurance at the time you book your cruise. Your HOT travel consultant can organise a quick and simple quote for you. Can I book my complete holiday including a cruise? Your local HOT travel consultant will be able to curate you the perfect holiday making sure that it all works like clockwork. We can organise your flights, transfers, an amazing cruise, then accommodation and add in extras like a tour, car hire or sightseeing etc. This is where using a HOT travel consultant is critical – it’s complex and our consultants are expert and making it the best holiday ever. How can I cancel or make changes my cruise booking? We know ‘life’ happens. To cancel your booking, get in contact with your HOT travel consultant as soon as you can. Please note that cancellation fees will apply. Similarly, if you need to make any changes or amendments, we can help, but again, be prepared, change / amendment fees will apply. Some of your booking may be non-refundable. When is my final payment due? Your final payment will be due approximately four to five months before departure. You can find all payment amounts and due dates on your Booking Advice. When will I receive my travel documents? Approximately one to two weeks before your departure date. These documents will be sent directly to your email. If in doubt, ask your HOT travel consultant. You would have already received your online passenger information to complete well in advance. Can I hold a cruise booking? Pricing for cruises is dynamic and is subject to change. Talk to one of our HOT travel consultants and they can talk you through how it can / does work. How do I book a cruise for more than 4 people, or book multiple staterooms?
