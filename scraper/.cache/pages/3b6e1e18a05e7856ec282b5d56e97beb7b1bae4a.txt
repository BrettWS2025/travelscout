Welcome to Comoros! On arrival at Prince Said Ibrahim International Airport, you will be met by an Intrepid representative and transferred to your hotel, ready for your adventure to begin at 6pm with an important welcome meeting. Then perhaps enjoy dinner in the oasis of the hotel grounds and learn more about this fascinating country from your local leader. A complimentary shared group transfer is included on your arrival. Please provide your flight details at the time of booking, or at a minimum 14 days prior to travel. Day 2: Moroni This morning, head north into rugged and jagged geographical formations, created through millions of years of volcanic activity. Your guide will share local myths about the ancient origins of these striking land features, including Dos du Dragon, Lac Salé, the Miraculous Mosque and Trou du Prophete. At this last stop, lunch is served at Miki’s, a rustic lean-to “restaurant” under a baobab tree next to the sea. If Miki is around, he'll be happy to offer his colourful commentary on life in Comoros at no extra charge. After lunch, kick off your shoes and stroll to Maloudja Beach, where you can relax among the coconut palms or go for a dip in the Indian Ocean. Day 3: Moheli After breakfast, catch a ferry to the island of Moheli. In 2020, this island and its surrounding waters were designated by UNESCO as the Mwali Biosphere Reserve in an effort to protect its rich diversity. You'll take a scenic drive to your beachfront accommodation, passing through tropical rainforests and alongside turquoise ocean views. Upon arrival, have lunch and head out on a village walk, meeting local people and learning about day-to-day life in this remote fishing village. On the outskirts of the settlement, visit a ylang-ylang plantation and distillery. The distillery may not be operating during your visit, but your guide will explain how essential oil is extracted from this tropical plant, which is one of Comoros’ primary exports and forms the basis of Chanel No. 5 perfume and other famous fragrances. Day 4: Moheli This morning, you'll take to the blue-green waters for some island hopping and snorkelling! These waters are part of the biosphere reserve and are home to the second-highest marine diversity in the world. See the cliffs and frigatebirds of Magnougni Island before hopping off the boat on the uninhabited Ouenefou Island. Pop on your flippers and mask for some snorkelling across vibrant coral reefs with an array of colourful tropical fish. Enjoy a barbecue picnic lunch cooked for you there on the deserted island, then board your boat to return to the lodge. The afternoon is yours to explore and soak up island life however you’d like. Wander the grounds to spot the family of lemurs that often visits, or head for a swim in the lagoon frequented by hawksbill turtles. Early this evening, sit down with a National Park Ranger and learn about the local biodiversity and ongoing conservation efforts of the Moheli National Park. Day 5: Moheli Head back out on the water after breakfast today, this time in search of whales! Humpback whales migrate thousands of miles to the warm, shallow waters around Mohéli to give birth. If you’re lucky, you may spot some mothers with their new calves. Keep your eyes peeled for spinner and tropical spotted dolphins, too! Back at the lodge, enjoy lunch and spend the afternoon exploring or relaxing at your leisure. It’s often possible to closely observe Seychelles fruit bats, which can grow to up to 80 cm from wing to wing, within the lodge grounds. Day 6: Moheli This morning, you'll hike into the subtropical rainforest to see one of the world’s largest bats, the Livingstone's flying fox, with a wingspan of up to 1.4 metres. They’re a critically endangered species found only on Moheli and neighbouring Anjouan Island. Follow a stream towards the mountains as your guide points out local medicinal trees, spices, coffee and fruit trees. After a steep climb, you’ll be able to spot these giant bats sunning themselves in the trees and circling their roosts on the morning thermals. After, you'll return to the lodge for lunch, and the afternoon is free for you to relax after your morning adventure. Day 7: Itsamia Today you're off to the other side of Moheli to the village of Itsamia, a major sea turtle traffic hub! First up, learn about the village, its history, its turtles and how it all connects at a presentation by one of the national park’s eco-guards. Every year, more than 20,000 green turtles nest on these beaches, making this stretch of sand one of the highest density nesting sites in the world. There are nesting turtles on this beach almost every night. This afternoon, explore the village of Itsamia on a village walk and then hit the beach to spot turtle nests, where you might witness up to 100 baby turtles emerging from the sand and scurrying down to the water. After dinner, head back to the beach to try to catch a glimpse of momma turtles arriving back on the beach, lugging their 150-kg bodies up the sand in search of the perfect spot to nest. As for you, you’ll rest up in simple beachside bungalows built and operated by the local community as an economic development project. A volunteer from the community will be preparing dinner for you as well. Day 8: Moroni Say goodbye to Moheli as you catch a ferry back to the main island, Grand Comore. Lunch will be at a local resident’s home, where you get to see how meals are made and take part in these preparations. Then visit the ancient sultan’s capital of Iconi. This historic village sits in the shadow of a steep volcanic cone, where, in the 1880s, many women jumped to their deaths to avoid enslavement by Malagasy pirates. On a village walk, see the sultan’s palace, Kaviri Djewe, built from coral limestone in the town’s centre, and the historic bangwes, open spaces where men still meet to debate and make decisions for the community. Back in Moroni, walk along the oceanfront with the stunning views of the Old Friday Mosque, which has stood on this since the 15th century. Then walk through the narrow alleyways of the old town, with its carved doors and moss-covered walls. Finish your city tour with a stroll through the town market, full of spices, seafood, and colourful clothing. In the evening, celebrate the end of your adventure over dinner with your travel companions at a local restaurant right on the beach. Day 9: Moroni Your trip comes to an end today, and there are no activities planned. A complimentary transfer is included. Please confirm your departure flight details at least 14 days before travel.
