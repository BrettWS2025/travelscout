The Darwin region, like much of the Top End, experiences a tropical climate with a wet and dry season and boasts a vibrant multicultural community, where Indigenous heritage blends seamlessly with the influence of diverse international populations. Darwin's rich history provides an incredible background for the diverse cultural and historical activities. On the 9th September 1839, HMS Beagle sailed into Darwin harbor during its survey of the area. John Clements Wickham named the region “Port Darwin” in honor of their former shipmate Charles Darwin. The city has been rebuilt almost entirely four times, following cyclones and Japanese air raids in World War II. Day 2: King George River, Western Australia, Australia 02 Jul 27 Arrives: 12:00 PM Departs: 07:00 PM Explore the King George Falls, the two highest twin waterfalls in Australia at 80m/250ft in height. The river was named in 1911 by explorer Charles Conigrave after a privately funded expedition in the area. The river is named in honor of King George V. This incredible sandstone gorge is a highlight of any Kimberley Expedition. INCLUDED EXPEDITION--NO BOOKING REQUIRED * Zodiac Tour Join the expedition team as we leave our anchorage position in Koolama Bay and head into the entrance of the King George River and falls. The 10 nautical mile Zodiac expedition takes us through a winding sandstone gorge, with incredible honeycomb and vertical erosion. Keep a lookout for Saltwater crocodiles, sleeping on the banks of the river. A wide variety of birdlife will also be pointed out by your Zodiac driver/naturalist. The highlight is of course the King George Falls, the two highest twin waterfalls in Australia at 80m/250ft in height. Depending on conditions we hope to get the Zodiacs close to the waterfalls for a refreshing spray to cool us down. This zodiac tour really is one of the highlights of the Kimberley region and a wonder of nature. *Please note this expedition experience is exclusively available on our expedition ships, Seabourn Venture or Seabourn Pursuit. All shore excursions shared here are subject to availability and are weather and conditions permitting. Day 3: Vansittart Bay, Western Australia, Australia 03 Jul 27 Arrives: 07:00 AM Departs: 03:00 PM Vansittart Bay is a small remote bay of about 30k m², synonymous with the Truscott air base that was operational during the Second World War. The bay features beaches and aircraft wrecks, but the reason for our visit is the Gwion Gwion or Bradshaw art found on Jar Island. Jar Island was named by an early survey team who found clay jars on the island. These jars were the same type as those used by the Macassans who would travel down from (what today we know as) Indonesia to the top end of Australia in search of sea cucumbers. According to Aboriginal legend, the art was created by birds. It was said that these birds pecked the rocks until their beaks bled, and then created these fine paintings by using a tail feather and their own blood. The bird said responsible was known as Gwion. The Gwion Gwion art is often called Bradshaw art after Joseph Bradshaw, the first European person to record the style of painting in 1891. INCLUDED EXPEDITION--NO BOOKING REQUIRED * Zodiac Landing on Jar Island: This morning, we will head out with the expedition team to explore the uninhabited, Jar Island. From the ship's anchorage position, a short Zodiac ride will bring you ashore for a wet landing onto a perfectly white sandy beach. Once ashore, a short walk of about 250m/750ft along a flat sandy beach and then on to flat rocks, will bring you to the base of the rock art gallery that depicts the Bradshaw or Gwion Gwion art. After a short scramble over some rocks, you will be at the gallery itself, enjoying a rare glimpse into a fascinating part of history along with a vivid interpretation by the expedition team. *Please note this expedition experience is exclusively available on our expedition ships, Seabourn Venture or Seabourn Pursuit. All shore excursions shared here are subject to availability and are weather and conditions permitting. Day 4: Ashmore Reef, Australia 04 Jul 27 Arrives: 08:00 AM Departs: 01:00 PM Ashmore Reef Marine Park is an Australian marine park that covers the Ashmore Reef, which is located about 630 km (390 mi) north of Broome and 110 km (68 mi) south of the Indonesian Islands of Rote. The marine park covers an area of 583 km² (225 sq mi). It is one of 13 parks managed under the North West Marine Network. The marine park comprises several marine habitats, including seagrass meadows, intertidal sand flats, coral reef flats, and lagoons, and supports an important and diverse range of species, including 14 species of sea snakes, a population of dugong that may be genetically distinct, a diverse marine invertebrates fauna, and many endemic species, especially of sea snakes and mollusks. There are feeding and nesting sites for loggerhead, hawksbill, and green turtles. INCLUDED EXPEDITION--NO BOOKING REQUIRED * Snorkeling *Please note this expedition experience is exclusively available on our expedition ships, Seabourn Venture or Seabourn Pursuit. All shore excursions shared here are subject to availability and are weather and conditions permitting. Day 5: The Seabourn Kimberley Experience 05 Jul 27 Arrives: 07:00 AM Departs: 05:00 PM Imagine waking up to the golden hush of dawn as your ship glides through ancient sandstone gorges, the air thick with the scent of salt and adventure. This is no ordinary day— with no fixed itinerary, the day unfolds like a secret whispered by the land itself. We will search for the region's unique wildlife—shy but nimble short-eared wallabies foraging in the cool shadows of the cliffs, and giant saltwater crocodiles silently surveying the mangroves. The Expedition Leader crafts a bespoke adventure, guided by tides, weather, and instinct. This is the Kimberley at its most raw, most real—and most unforgettable. Day 6: Hunter River, Western Australia, Australia 06 Jul 27 Arrives: 07:00 AM Departs: 05:00 PM The Hunter River was named in 1820 by the explorer Philip Parker King aboard the Mermaid Cutter, while making charts in the area. The river was named after the surgeon on Mermaid, James Hunter. The river is home to a large mangrove estuary, that forms part of Porosus Creek (Crocodile Creek) and home to several bird species, Osprey, Brahminy Kite, and White-tailed Sea eagles. Mitchell River National Park is one of Kimberley's two national parks. The park lies in some of the most remote and inaccessible country in Australia. It is about 350 km north-east of Derby, and 270 km north-west of Wyndham. The park of 115,300 hectares lies in a remote part of the Kimberley and contains some of the region's scenic jewels. The Mitchell Plateau is one of the most scenic and biologically important areas of the State. Small patches of rainforest grow around the margins of the plateau, where they are protected from fire and receive additional moisture. INCLUDED EXPEDITION--NO BOOKING REQUIRED * Zodiac Cruise Leaving the ship from its anchorage position, we will start our Zodiac tour of Hunter River, passing first Naturalist Island and then Indian Head. (a sandstone headland depicting the head of an Indian) You then start to enter the mouth of the Hunter River. Near the end of Hunter River, we turn left down Porosus Creek named aptly after the many saltwater crocodiles that call the area home. Depending on the tide, we will have the opportunity to head into the mangroves and explore this unique environment, coupled with detailed interpretation of the area. Keep a look out, as sightings of saltwater crocodiles, osprey, White Bellied Sea Eagles and Brahminy Kites are quite common. This is a magnificent Zodiac cruise show casing one of the Kimberley highlights. *Please note this expedition experience is exclusively available on our expedition ships, Seabourn Venture or Seabourn Pursuit. All shore excursions shared here are subject to availability and are weather and conditions permitting. Day 7: Kuri Bay, Western Australia, Australia 07 Jul 27 Arrives: 07:00 AM Departs: 05:00 PM This lovely bay is located in the remote fjordlands of Australia’s northwest Kimberley region, some 140 miles from the nearest town of Derby. The name springs from the fact that the bay houses Australia’s first pearl farm, started in 1956 by Tokiuchi Kuribayashi, who perfected the techniques of cultivating silver-lip pearl oysters in the warm Indian Ocean waters after Australia authorized production of cultured pearls. Today the aquatic farm is operated by the Paspaley company, and at one time produced about 60% of the world’s large white South Sea pearls. The bay is alive with other sea life, including sharks, turtles and huge saltwater crocodiles. It is part of the Prince Regent Nature Reserve, as well as the Kumunya Aboriginal Reserve. The nearby Camden Sound Marine Reserve is the most important humpback whale calving grounds in the world, attracting up to 1,000 whales during the season from October to June. Another famous sight is the “horizontal waterfalls” created by the huge Montgomery Reef, Australia’s largest inshore reef, when the 10-meter tide change creates immense cascades of water off the sides as the reef-top “island” appears above the receding sea. A visit to Sheep Island reveals the ruins of a 19th century settlement, along with the graves bearing silent witness to the settler’s failure. The rugged cliffs glow red at sunrise and sunset. Day 8: Montgomery Reef, Western Australia, Australia 08 Jul 27 Arrive: 05:30 AM Depart: 10:00 AM Montgomery Reef is a reef off the Kimberley coast of Western Australia. It is situated at the southwestern Camden Sound end of and surrounds Yawajaba (Montgomery) Island. With its total area of 400 square kilometers (154 sq mi) it is the world's largest inshore reef. The reef and island were named by Philip Parker King, the first European to sight the island, aboard the HMS Mermaid while exploring the area in 1818. King named the island after the ship's surgeon, Andrew Montgomery. When the tide is out, vast lagoons, sandstone islets, and a central mangrove island are revealed. The outward movement of the tide forms a torrent of water, creating a river cutting through the reef and hundreds of cascading waterfalls. At low tide, more than 4 meters (13 ft) of reef can be exposed. While the tide is going out, the waterfalls attract migratory wading birds, feeding turtles manta rays, black tipped reef sharks and dugongs. EXPEDITION SHORE EXCURSION: Zodiac Cruise Arriving on high tide, we leave the ship and head out by Zodiac to the edge of Montgomery reef. As soon as the tide drops it exposes the “river” a narrow channel we will explore by Zodiac. We will witness torrent water and endless cascading waterfalls. As the water drops further, the reef is exposed, and fish are trapped on the reef and in pools. They brings in an array of birdlife. Keep a look out for the white and grey morph eastern reef egret, ospreys, white bellied sea eagles and the beach thick knee. In the water we hope to see dugongs, stokes sea snake, tawny nurse sharks and hammerhead sharks. When the tide is out, many turtles are concentrated into the "river", and over a few hours one can see dozens and dozens of them. They are often found both in the water and stranded on the reef. Day 8: Freshwater Cove, Western Australia, Australia 08 Jul 27 Arrives: 11:45 am Departs: 11:59 PM Wiggingarra Butt Butt (Freshwater Cove) lies on the mainland adjacent to Montgomery Reef. Named appropriately, as fresh water pours from out the ground all year round, making this an ideal area for a traditional camp. The area is managed in partnership with the Damibmangari traditional owners, who have strong cultural connections to the Lalang-garram / Camden Sound Marine Park and Montgomery Islands. Day 9: Talbot Bay, Western Australia, Australia 09 JUL 27 Arrives: 02:30 AM Departs: 03:00 PM Talbot Bay is the site of the Horizontal Waterfalls, which lie about 20 miles to the east of Cockatoo Island in the Buccaneer Archipelago. The effect of the waterfalls is created by the rapid tidal fall on the ocean-side of gaps in the sandstone cliffs. Waters on the inland side of the gaps cannot escape fast enough and so a ‘’horizontal waterfall’’ is created by the cascades, with water levels differing sometimes by several meters on either side of the gaps. The gaps themselves were once layers of siltstone in the strata of the sedimentary rock. It is through these gaps that tide movements push sea water to create the Horizontal Waterfalls. Day 10: Lacepede Island, Western Australia, Australia 10 Jul 27 Arrive: 07:00 AM Depart: 05:00 PM The Lacepede Islands are a remote and pristine region, located in the Kimberley region of Western Australia. It is renowned for its stunning natural beauty and abundant wildlife. The islands feature rugged coastlines, white sandy beaches, and crystal-clear waters, making it a haven for nature enthusiasts and birdwatchers. Lacepede Islands are particularly famous for nesting seabirds, including the brown booby and the roseate tern. The islands are also an important site for marine life, with coral reefs and diverse fish species in its surrounding waters. Visitors can enjoy snorkeling, wildlife observation, and the untouched wilderness of this isolated and unspoiled island group. It offers a unique opportunity to experience the unspoiled beauty of the Kimberley coastline. Day 11: Broome, Western Australia, Australia 11 Jul 27 Arrives: 07:00 AM Perched on the Northwest edge of Western Australia, Broome was once an isolated gem, reachable only by a rugged dirt road until the mid-1980s. The town is nestled on a narrow peninsula, encircled by the crystal-clear sapphire waters of the Indian Ocean and the tranquil expanse of Roebuck Bay. It stands as a global haven for migratory birds, offering them a scenic stopover on their long journeys. Broome sprang to life following the discovery of the world's most abundant pearl shell deposit. This revelation sparked a frenzy akin to a gold rush, drawing in hundreds of people lured by the promise of precious treasures. Despite a downturn in the pearl industry during the last century, the allure of Broome's natural splendor and serene ambiance held many captives, anchoring them to this coastal sanctuary. Today, Broome boasts a unique architectural landscape, a testament to its diverse history. A blend of colonial buildings, old mission houses, churches, and the huts of former pearling masters share the streets with more modern homes. These structures collectively echo a distinctive style that took root over eighty years ago.
