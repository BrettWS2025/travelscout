Please meet between 7:45 - 8:00 am. Leave everyday life behind and depart the Old Woolstore in Hobart for the scenic journey from Hobart to Coles Bay, taking in wide panoramas of the Freycinet Peninsula across Great Oyster Bay. After morning tea at historic Spiky Bridge near Swansea, board the Naturaliste in Coles Bay for a spectacular sea cruise down the western length of the Peninsula to Schouten Island, the southernmost part of Freycinet National Park (weather permitting). On the way, keep a lookout for pods of playful dolphins and large Australasian gannets diving for food.After a picnic lunch, snorkel and swim, choose between a walk up Bear Hill for magnificent views, or fish for flathead in Schouten Passage with our coxswain. Return to Coles Bay by boat, then transfer to Friendly Beaches Lodge for a three course evening meal of fresh fish (perhaps caught by you that day!), local produce, fine wine and craft beers.If weather does not permit our boat cruise, not to worry, we have additional cruising in our days to come! Your knowledgeable guides have a suite of awe inspiring alternatives including a visit to the stunning Sleepy Bay - rarely visited by travellers to the Peninsula and an absolute gem (particularly for sightings of marine life!). Day 2 Coastal: 7 hour walk, 14 km, moderate, 213m total elevation Mt Graham: 8 hour walk, 16 km, difficult, 792m total elevation Rise with the sun for another boat adventure along the Peninsula. Today, choose from one of two amazing day walks! 1. The peaceful coastal walk from Bryan’s Beach journeys through sclerophyll forests and along secluded beaches - bring your swimmers! Listen out for the Eastern Banjo Frog as you meander through Hazards Lagoon and emerge onto the renowned Wineglass Bay. Along the way, take a moment to search for native orchids and encounter unforgettable ‘up-close’ moments with local and endemic bird and wild life. 2. For those seeking a serious challenge, opt for the ascent from Cook’s Beach to the top of Mt Graham where you’ll enjoy stunning views of The Hazards' dusky pink rock outcrops, before descending to Wineglass Bay via the spectacular Quartzite Ridge. The two groups rejoin at Wineglass Bay in late afternoon – the perfect time to swim in its crystalline waters, enjoy a cup of tea and exchange stories about the morning’s adventures. Feeling refreshed, take the climb to Wineglass Bay Lookout for sublime views, then descend to be met by your lodge hosts and private vehicle. Back at the lodge, enjoy soothing hot showers, warm baths and a stretch on your bushside infinity deck before drinks and dinner. Day 3 6-7 hour walk, 14km, easy to moderate, 205m total elevation Enjoy a hearty breakfast before transferring to secluded Bluestone Bay for the start of today's walk. Explore the fascinating geology of White Water Wall and little Bluestone Bay before climbing to the cliff tops. Journey back to the lodge on foot, following an ancient track through sacred bushland once followed by the Oyster Bay Tribe and now used exclusively by Freycinet Experience. The headland is home to a stunning array of native plants, including the giant Xanthorrhea (Grass Trees). Continue along the white sands of Friendly Beaches, perhaps celebrating with a dip in the sparkling ocean waters. Then arrive back at the lodge where cool drinks and homemade afternoon tea await. End your day savouring a well-deserved meal (and perhaps an extra serving of dessert!) then, with a glass of wine or beer, relax in our library and peruse Joan's collection, or, stretch out by the roaring fire and listen to the ocean. Day 4 3 hour walk, 6 km, easy, 96m elevation - optional Rise early and head to the beach for morning coffee, or sleep in and watch the bird life outside your bedroom window. After breakfast, you have the option of taking a walk along the fossil-rich ridgeline of Mt Mary and a descent to Saltwater Lagoon, where you’ll experience the curious honks and calls of countless wild black swans and pelicans in their natural nesting ground. Alternatively, you might wish to read on the beach, take a dip, or do some yoga on our decks. After a delightful brunch – a convivial affair where experiences of the last four days are recalled and delicious food is shared, take a final stroll along Friendly Beaches to Isaac’s Point, the meeting place for a bus trip back to Hobart.
