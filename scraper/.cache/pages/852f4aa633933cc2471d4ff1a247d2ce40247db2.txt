This eight-day small-ship cruise offers plenty of that idle relaxation, broken upwith exciting activities like a river cruise and a walk to the waterfalls of the Krka National Park. Take on expeditions like a winery trip near Korcula and get a taste of what the Dalmatian Coast has to offer, all with a local leader and group of likeminded travellers. Theme Adventure Cruising Highlights Discover Krka National Park, where you’ll get to see stunning waterfalls and secluded pools. Dive into the aquamarine waters of the Dalmatian Coast. Weather permitting, your captain will be stopping the boat for regular swim breaks during the trip. Drop anchor in the middle of port towns like Hvar or Korcula – while large cruise liners have to moor out at sea and commute into shore, you can hop on or off the boat as you please! Sail up the Neretva River to Opuzen. Here, you’ll transfer to small, traditional boats and sail around the wetlands, making your way to a local restaurant on the water for Peka veal. Take a detour to Mostar in Bosnia and Herzegovina. You’ll see the town’s iconic bridge and have the chance to watch a coffee demonstration.

You’ll meet your trip leader and group this evening at 5 pm, when you’ll be welcomed aboard the Aurora and introduced to your crew.
