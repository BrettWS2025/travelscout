Portugal’s vibrant capital and our home for the first two nights of our adventure. After meeting your small group of fellow explorers, we’ll kick off our journey with a group dinner in the historic Alfama district – Lisbon's oldest neighbourhood. It’s a nest of cobblestone alleys, pastel-coloured homes, and hidden bars and eateries just waiting to be discovered with every turn. As we weave through, spot clotheslines criss-crossed on narrow streets, potted plants perched on wrought-iron balconies and hear friendly chatter drift out from windows – it's easy to imagine what local life must be like here. At dinner, we’re in for a real treat as our meal will be accompanied by a traditional Fado performance. Prepare to be moved by this passionate artform that dates back to the early 1800s: typically a combination of atmospheric guitar and haunting, soaring vocals whose lyrics tell melancholic tales of love, loss and nostalgia. The evening’s soulful folk songs are sure to leave a lasting impression. (D) Day 2: Lisbon Have you noticed the intricately-patterned tiles on the facades of Lisbon’s buildings? These ornate azulejos are a defining characteristic of Portuguese architecture, dating back to the 13th century. Their striking blue-and-white designs immortalise Portugal’s history and culture, from biblical tales to maritime journeys. This morning, it’s your turn to add to the tradition and get those creative juices flowing! We’ll visit a local atelier where you can paint your own one-of-a-kind tile. What story will you capture in your design, making it uniquely yours? Next, it’s on to medieval Sintra where we’ll enjoy a fascinating tour of the village’s National Palace with a knowledgeable local guide. This UNESCO World Heritage Site is straight out of a fairytale with its iconic, canonical chimneys and Moorish arched windows. Imagine yourself at a royal banquet in the Sala dos Cisnes where gilded frescoes line the ceiling, or cast yourself back to the Middle Ages, cooking up a storm in the palace’s vast kitchen... We’ll catch a glimpse of the glittering Cascais Coast on our way back to Lisbon where the afternoon is yours to uncover more of the city’s secrets. Why not take a ride on the iconic, yellow Tram 28 to really get to the heart of it all? (Be sure to grab a window seat!). Or, hunt down the city’s best pastel de nata. This egg custard pastry is a real classic (best enjoyed warm with a sprinkle of cinnamon), and you’ve sure earnt one (or two) after today’s adventures. Our top tip? Seek out one of the many viewpoints, or miradouros , for sunset. Known as the ‘City of Seven Hills', Lisbon's lookouts offer stunning panoramas over the city’s terracotta roofs and Tagus River as day gives way to night. (B) Day 3: Alvados Onwards to Óbidos! Where medieval castle walls embrace the historic centre like a warm hug, whitewashed houses pop with accents of brightly-coloured stripes and the scent of freshly-baked pão com chouriço (a moreish bread filled with rich chorizo sausage) drifts from the local bakery. We’ll take it all in on an orientation tour. And, while you’re here, don’t miss the Ginja de Óbidos – a local cherry liquor whose sweet and sour flavour zings on the tastebuds. Then, we’re off to the charming fishing town of Nazaré, where you’ll have free time to explore this world-renowned surfing mecca. You could simply stroll along the town’s golden beach and feel the sand’s warm glow beneath your feet. Or, why not take a walk to the hilltop, Sanctuary of Our Lady Nazareth? This hilltop church is home to the famous wooden carving of the Black Madonna. To close today’s chapter, we journey to Alvados, where you’ll settle into our stunning, nature-inspired hotel, that’s nestled in the Serra de Aire and Candeeiros Natural Park. Admire the lush olive groves from your room’s window and get ready for a peaceful sleep... But not before we roll up our sleeves for a cookery class and dinner. Be sure to make note of your favourite recipes for a taste of Portugal back home! (B,D) Day 4: Alvados Tomar’s Convento de Cristo beckons! As we explore this magnificent UNESCO World Heritage Site this morning, imagine the echo of footsteps from knights and monks of centuries past, gaze up at intricately-gilded frescoes and seek out the azulejos that adorn its hushed cloisters. Your in-theknow local guide will have plenty of tales to share about this 12th-century jewel, founded by the Knights Templar. Before returning to Alvados, there’s a treat in store for the foodies among us. We’ll pay a visit to a charming, family-run olive oil producer to learn all about what makes each golden drop of their local produce so delicious. We’ll start off with a guided tour of the estate, featuring a visit to the historic mill, to gain an insight into both traditional and modern production processes – from harvest through to pressing. Then, it’s time to awaken your senses with a guided tasting – you'll learn how to smell, sip and analyse the oil’s aroma, flavour profile and texture. You’ll also get to sample more regional delights like artisanal jams, cheese and local wine. This premium, extra virgin oil is too good to leave behind – we won’t blame you for buying a bottle (or three) to take home! This evening is yours to relax and soak up the serenity of our surroundings back at the hotel. You could set out on one of the nearby walking trails or take a dip in the outdoor pool and listen to the breeze gently tickle olive tree branches. The perfect way to end the day. (B) Day 5: Viseu Our journey north continues with a visit to Coimbra, home to its famed hilltop university. Founded in 1290 (yes, really!), it’s one of the oldest universities in the world; imagine yourself as a student as we wander through its historic grounds. The showpiece has got to be the legendary Joanina Library. Spot the trompe l’oeil fresco, gilded mouldings and intricately-carved wood whose lavish details solidify the library as a Baroque masterpiece. Before we descend back to the medieval centre for some free time, don’t miss a glimpse of the Mondego River from one of the university’s viewpoints, and seek out a Pastéis de Santa Clara (almond and egg-yolk pastry) for a local sweet treat. We’re heading into mountain territory this afternoon as we journey on to Viseu. But not before a visit to a traditional working farm. The farm’s cheesemakers will spill the secrets behind the unique flavour of their artisanal produce, and you’ll soon see why the local Queijo Serra da Estrela cheese is so celebrated. Following a fascinating overview of the cheese-making process, from milk curdling to mould maturation, we’ll even get to enjoy a private tasting session. You’ll try three distinctive types of Serra da Estrela cheese, Pão de Ló (traditional sponge cake), Broa Doce (sweetcorn bread) and more. Bom apetite! Once in Viseu, the evening is all yours. With plenty of dining options within walking distance of our centrally located hotel, you’ll have no shortage of places to choose from. (B) Day 6: Douro Valley Where terraced vineyards are etched into undulating hillsides like the raked sand of a Zen garden and a golden river meanders through the landscape like an unfurling ribbon – this is the Douro Valley. Drink it all in from the windows of the luxury minicoach as we thread our way through this soul-stirring region towards Lamego: a historic town nestled deep within the valley. Lamego is home to an astonishing, tree-lined Baroque staircase that features a formidable 686 steps, blue-and-white azulejos, and ornate sculptures that lead up to the Sanctuary of Our Lady of Good Remedy. We’ll enjoy an included visit to this 18th-century wonder before taking time to explore the city at our own pace. Later, we’ll turn our attention to Pinhão, where a private cruise on a traditional wooden rabelo boat awaits. These flat-bottomed boats were historically used to transport cargo along the river (including wine barrels, of course!). But, today, it’s our turn to hop in and get a front row seat of the valley’s cinematic scenery. How many wine estates can you spot along the way? Back on dry land, we'll journey to our hotel, nestled within a stunning vineyard, for another sumptuous dinner. Trade fun facts you’ve learnt today about the region’s wine and port and raise a glass to another day of discovering Portugal! (B,D) Day 7: Douro Valley The patchwork quilt of the valley’s rolling hills makes a serene backdrop to your free day. So, what takes your fancy? Will it be a guided tour and wine tasting followed by a stroll through the hotel’s vineyards? Or, perhaps a day spent relaxing by the listening pool with a picnic has your name on it. Decisions, decisions... Whatever story you choose to write today, this evening, we’ll reconvene with the group for a delicious dinner once again and share what we’ve been up to. Be sure to catch the sunset later – where a cotton candy sky gives way to the sapphire blue of night. (B,D) Day 8: Braga Tear yourself away from the Douro Valley – our sights are set on Amarante this morning, a tranquil riverside town characterised by its striking arched bridge and 16th-century São Gonçalo Church. Hear the echoes of prayer and the hum of the organ reverberate through the walls as you admire the gilded Baroque altar, before you set off to explore the town's narrow, medieval streets at your leisure. After lunch, we’ll set a course for Penafiel where we’ll indulge in a glass (or three) of the region’s famous vinho verde (green wine) at a family-run winery. A specialty of the region, this unique wine is known for its crisp flavour and slight fizz. Its fresh taste captures the essence of the grapes harvested in Portugal’s verdant northwest. Be sure to stock up on a bottle or two, that is, if you still have space left in your bags! An evening of exploration awaits as we arrive in charming Braga, and your Tour Leader is sure to have a host of recommendations for regional dishes to try for dinner. To kick things off, we hear the bacalhau (dried and salted cod baked with potatoes) and the pudim à abade de priscos (a sweet crème caramel pudding) are favourites, even with the locals. Our accommodation this evening? A 16th-century hospital-turned-hotel that’s brimming with history and even features restored original features, including vaulted ceilings. If these walls could talk... (B) Day 9: Braga Did you know, the medieval city of Guimarães was the birthplace of Afonso Henriques, Portugal’s first king? Often called the ‘cradle of Portugal’, we’ll get to know it a little better on a guided tour of the city’s two highlights – the castle and Palace of the Dukes of Braganza. Then, for lunch, step back in time to the Middle Ages and roam the city’s historic centre, where half-timbered houses and winding streets are steeped in centuries of stories. With full bellies, we’ll head back to Braga for an afternoon of exploring. While you’re here, be sure to pay a visit to the Bom Jesus Sanctuary – it’s one of Portugal’s most famous attractions for good reason. Here, you can follow in the footsteps of pilgrims who climb over 570 steps to reach the church at the top. Or, simply hop on the funicular for a more leisurely experience! Along the way, look out for the fountains that represent the five senses and sculptures that portray Old Testament characters. This evening, we’ll tuck into one last dinner together. A traditional folk performance is tonight’s grand finale, bookending our trip with another captivating experience. (B,D) Day 10: Porto With its postcard-perfect waterfront, world-renowned port wine and friendly locals, our journey through northern Portugal ends in Porto. We’ll stroll across the iconic Luís I Bridge and take a moment to reflect on the memories made over the past ten days. Soak in the spectacular panoramic views, spotting Porto's historic Ribeira district, port wine lodges on the Gaia side, and traditional rabelo boats floating along the Douro River. Before we say farewell, why not indulge in one last pastel de nata for good measure? The Francesinha (a decadent sandwich covered in a lavish, beer-based sauce) is also a must-try!
