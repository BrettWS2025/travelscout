Offering ten self-contained villas, each is secluded within tropical gardens laden with colourful native plants and flowers. The newly modernised villas are styled with designer interiors and artworks from across the Pacific making them unique to anything else on Rarotonga. Guests love to explore the colourful sea life of the lagoon with snorkelling and kayaking gear included with each stay, and using the electric bicycles to discover the beauty of this tiny island and its people. Or they can recline by the fresh water pool and enjoy a local beer on tap. Facing south, the quiet beach is largely protected from the easterly trade winds and westerly storms. In high summer you'll experience blazing sunrises and sunsets beyond the reef. All this with the imposing backdrop of a lush mountainous landscape.
