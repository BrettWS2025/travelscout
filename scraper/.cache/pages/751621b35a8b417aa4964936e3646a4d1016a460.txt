In the evening, there will be a welcome meeting in the hotel lobby to kick off your exciting journey. Day 2 The Forbidden City After breakfast, our first stop today will be the iconic Tiananmen Square, where Chairman Mao's tomb lies and various monuments to the people are located. While we won't enter the tomb, we will get to view the exterior. Following this, we'll enter the Forbidden City, a magnificent palace complex which served as the seat of power for Chinese emperors over five centuries. With over 800 buildings and 9,000 chambers, this is one of China's best preserved historical treasures. Tickets to the Forbidden City are limited, see trip notes for more information. In the afternoon, delve into Beijing's hutongs, a maze-like network of ancient alleyways that form the city's historical core.

A UNESCO World Heritage Site, the Great Wall stands as an enduring symbol of Chinese civilization and ingenuity. Initially constructed for defensive purposes, it snakes an impressive 6,700 kilometers across diverse terrains and towering mountains. We'll be visiting the Huanghuacheng section of the Great Wall, known as the "Yellow Flower Great Wall." Its name originates from the vibrant yellow wildflowers that bloom along the wall during specific seasons. What sets Huanghuacheng apart is that a portion of the wall is partially submerged underwater. We'll embark on a scenic hike along the wall, offering breathtaking views and a deeper understanding of the structure's historical significance. This evening promises an enchanting spectacle as we attend a Chinese acrobatic performance. These skilled artists will leave you spellbound with their gravity-defying feats. Day 4 Welcome to Luoyang Beijing - Luoyang. After breakfast this morning, we'll head to the railway station for a comfortable 2nd class high-speed train journey to Luoyang, which will take approximately 4-4.5 hours. Luoyang is one of the four ancient Chinese capitals, renowned for its magnificent peony blooms and the celestial Longmen Caves. After meeting our local guide and enjoying lunch at a local restaurant, prepare to be captivated by the Longmen Caves, a UNESCO World Heritage site. These remarkable caves are perched densely along the cliffs lining the Yi River, and they house the world's most extensive collection of celestial art treasures, boasting the largest array of statues to be found anywhere on Earth. This enduring art form, etched into the stone, has not only withstood the test of time but has also borne witness to the reign of over 10 dynasties spanning more than 1,400 years. In the evening, we'll take a stroll through Old City Shizi Steet, a renowned food street in old city Luoyang. Here, you'll have the chance to follow tantalizing aromas and sample a wide variety of local flavours. Day 5 Xiyuan Park & Shaolin Monastery Today will begin with a visit to the vibrant Xiyuan Park. Here, residents gather to dance and sing, infusing the park with a lively burst of morning energy. It's an excellent opportunity to observe and perhaps even join in the joyful morning activities that reflect the spirit of the community. Afterwards, brace yourself for an exhilarating adventure as we head to the legendary Shaolin Monastery, renowned as the reputed birthplace of Chinese martial arts.

Today, we'll catch an early morning train bound for Xi'an. Upon arriving, we'll start our day with a bike ride or a leisurely walk along the Xi'an City Wall, one of the oldest and best-preserved Chinese city walls. This remarkable structure offers stunning panoramic views over the city, blending ancient and modern architecture, and providing an unforgettable glimpse into the past. Afterwards, get ready for the sensory delights of Xi'an's Muslim Quarter, a bustling neighbourhood in the heart of the city. Here, the air is thick with the mouthwatering aromas of sizzling lamb skewers and fragrant spices emanating from the food stalls that line the narrow alleys. Engage with the warm and welcoming locals, witness their skilled craftsmanship in action, and let the diverse flavours tantalize your taste buds. Not far from the Muslim Quarter, discover the majestic courtyard of the Gao Family. Within these hallowed walls, a unique spectacle awaits-a 15-minute shadow puppetry show, an art form believed to originate from this province. These performances breathe life into simple yet vibrant leather or paper figures, spinning enchanting narratives that have captivated audiences for generations. Then, pay your respects at the Small Wild Goose Pagoda, a serene contrast to the bustling Big Wild Goose Pagoda. Within this peaceful Buddhist complex, you'll discover intriguing exhibits in the Xi'an Museum. Tonight, roll up your sleeves and try your hand at making dumplings, a local delicacy that is also a true form of culinary art. Enjoy the delicious dumplings you've created, accompanied by a refreshing drink. Day 7 Terracotta Warriors Our day begins with a visit to the awe-inspiring Terracotta Army and Warriors, a UNESCO World Heritage site. This remarkable collection of terracotta sculptures depicts the armies of Qin Shi Huang, the first Emperor of China. These life-sized figures were meticulously modeled after actual soldiers of the Qin Army, displaying incredible attention to detail. The army consists of an astounding 8,000 life-size soldiers, 100 chariots, and 600 horses, and each figure is unique. The purpose of this vast army was to guard the remains of Emperor Qin Shihuang, entombed within a massive mausoleum complex. Next, you'll have the opportunity to visit a Terracotta Warrior Factory. Here, you can delve deeper into the intricate production process, which remains unchanged since the time of the Qin Dynasty. Gain insights into the techniques behind these captivating artworks, adding a layer of appreciation to these ancient treasures. After lunch at a local restaurant, we'll return to the hotel.
