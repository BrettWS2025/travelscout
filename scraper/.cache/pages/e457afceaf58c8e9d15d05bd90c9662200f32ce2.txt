Chioggia, a charming fishing village at the southern tip of the Venetian Lagoon, is renowned for its age-old seafaring traditions. Nicknamed “Little Venice” due to its canals, bridges, and fishing boats, Chioggia offers a lively atmosphere along its main pedestrian street, Corso del Popolo, lined with shops, bars, and seafood restaurants. With its rich cultural and economic ties to Venice dating back to the Middle Ages, Chioggia is a scenic journey by water taxi from Venice. Day 2: Venice (Chioggia), Italy The Venetian Republic dominated the Adriatic for a millennium, flourishing as the Roman Empire declined. Many Europeans fled to Venice and its neighbouring towns like Chioggia during this period, leading to a thriving city-state. The Venetian Lagoon's canal banks showcase buildings influenced by Byzantine and Islamic architecture, reflecting Venice’s extensive trading network. The first vaporetto, Venice’s iconic water bus, began operating on the Grand Canal in 1881, complementing the city’s traditional gondolas. Day 3: Split, Croatia Split, one of Croatia’s oldest cities, was built around Emperor Diocletian’s Roman Palace. The city’s promenade offers stunning views over the bay and the Adriatic Sea. Although Split’s origins trace back to the 6th century BC, it is traditionally considered over 1,700 years old from the palace’s construction. The palace's well-preserved remains are seamlessly integrated into the modern city, including the Ethnographic Museum and the ancient mausoleum, now a striking cathedral. Day 4: Dubrovnik, Croatia Dubrovnik, a historic gem with a dramatic Adriatic setting, is renowned for its well-preserved medieval architecture. George Bernard Shaw famously called it “paradise on Earth.” Enclosed by a towering medieval wall, the Old Town features the Stradun, lined with authentic stone houses. Visit the serene 14th-century Franciscan Monastery and Apothecary, home to the world’s oldest functioning pharmacy and a fine collection of Renaissance art. Day 5: Corfu (Kérkyra), Greece Corfu’s rich history, shaped by conquerors and royalty, is evident in its UNESCO World Heritage-listed Old Town and Fortress, crafted by the Venetian Republic. Explore the narrow streets leading to one of Europe’s largest public squares and a picturesque promenade once reserved for aristocrats. Enjoy magnificent coastal views and explore historical sites like the Paleopolis archaeological area and the Vlacherna Monastery, as well as a former Greek royal villa. Day 6: Sail the Ionian Sea Sail through the Ionian Sea, which marks the gateway to the Adriatic, bordered by Italy’s boot and the western coasts of Albania and Greece. While on board, visit our well-curated Library, nestled in a cozy alcove of the Living Room, and choose from a wide selection of books. Relax by the Main Pool, a year-round oasis with a retractable roof, ideal for swimming in any weather. Day 7: Naples, Italy Naples, renowned for its pizza and rich history, is set against a stunning seaside backdrop. As a major cultural hub and once an independent kingdom for 500 years, Naples attracted top architects and artists. In the grand Piazza del Plebiscito, the San Francesco di Paola Church features a colonnaded façade reminiscent of Rome’s Pantheon, while the Royal Palace overlooks the city with statues of Naples’ kings. Day 8: Rome (Civitavecchia), Italy Rome, with over 2,500 years of history, once ruled much of Europe with its vast empire. The city’s streets are steeped in history, from the Colosseum’s roaring crowds to the Forum and Pantheon. Alongside the Vatican and St. Peter’s Basilica, Rome offers some of the world’s greatest historical and cultural treasures. Day 9: Florence/Pisa (Livorno), Italy Tuscany, the birthplace of the Renaissance and a haven for culinary delights and fine wines, is home to Florence, a living Renaissance museum. Admire Brunelleschi’s iconic Duomo, a marvel of architecture. In Pisa, visit the Square of Miracles, where the Leaning Tower, Pisa Cathedral, and Baptistery represent some of Europe’s finest art and architecture. Day 10: Monte Carlo, Monaco Monte Carlo, the glamorous city-state of Monaco, offers exclusive shopping and a beautiful old port. With its fairy-tale allure, the city is renowned for the Prince’s Palace, where the late actress-turned-princess Grace Kelly once resided with Prince Rainier III. Monte Carlo’s medieval quarter, perched on “The Rock” at the foot of the Maritime Alps, provides stunning views of the Mediterranean and a harbour filled with mega-yachts. Day 11: Marseille, France Marseille, nestled between the Mediterranean and limestone hills, is rich in historical treasures. The Vieux Port, or Old Port, features two 17th-century fortresses and a picturesque quay lined with cafés and shops. Explore the city center along La Canebière boulevard and enjoy a café visit to sample the local bouillabaisse made from freshly caught fish. Day 12: Barcelona, Spain Barcelona, known for its vibrant culture and inviting outdoor spaces, boasts a rich history. Wander through the Gothic Quarter’s medieval streets, where remnants of the city’s Roman wall are visible. Highlights include the neo-Gothic Barcelona Cathedral, the medieval Jewish district of El Call, and the Romanesque Church of Santa Maria del Pi. Enjoy dinner in the Royal Plaza, with its elegant restaurants and lively atmosphere. Day 13: Barcelona, Spain After breakfast, disembark your ship and journey home.
