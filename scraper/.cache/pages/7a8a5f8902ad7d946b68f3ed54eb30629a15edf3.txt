Please visit the Aurora Expeditions hospitality desk to collect your luggage cabin tags and to speak with our ground operations team, who may have information to share with you about pre-embarkation procedures and the charter flight to Nuuk tomorrow. You will receive Aurora Expeditions cabin tags for your luggage. Please clearly label the tags with your name and ship cabin number. The remainder of your time is at leisure. All meals today are at your own expense. Accommodation: Westin Toronto Airport Hotel (or similar) Day 2: Fly to Nuuk, embarkation Please ensure that your luggage is fitted with cabin tags clearly labelled with your name and cabin number. Any valuables or personal items should be kept on you throughout the day. Your luggage will be delivered to your cabin ahead of your arrival on board. After breakfast at the hotel, board our charter flight to Nuuk, where the Greg Mortimer awaits. After embarkation, there is time to settle into your cabin before our important safety briefings. This evening, meet your expedition team and crew. Day 3: Sisimiut After a morning sailing north towards the Arctic Circle, we arrive in Sisimiut, Greenland’s second largest town. Sisimiut is located approximately 54 kilometres (33.5 miles) north of the Arctic Circle, meaning that during summer, you can experience the midnight sun here. The town is famous for the old blue church with the gate made of whale bone. In the cosy museum next door to the church, you will find an excellent reconstruction of an Inuit turf house as well as exhibits of local history and early life in Greenland. Approximately 4,500 years ago, the Saqqaq culture arrived from Canada and settled in the area. They lived here for approximately 2,000 years, after which they mysteriously disappeared from the area. The Dorset culture arrived around 500 CE and stayed until the 1200s until they were replaced by the Thule culture, and today, the majority of the population of Sisimiut are descendants of the Thule culture. Day 4: Ilulissat In the afternoon we arrive in Ilulissat. Known as the ‘birthplace of icebergs’, this region produces some of the most dazzling icebergs found anywhere on Earth. Hike to the UNESCO World Heritage-listed Icefjord viewpoint and stand in awe of its immensity. Sermeq Kujalleq, also known as Jakobshavn Glacier, is the most productive glacier – not only in Greenland but the entire Northern Hemisphere. It produces 20 million tonnes of ice each day, all floating into the Ilulissat Icefjord and Disko Bay. Day 5-6: Northwest Greenland expedition cruising Explore the remote northern reaches of West Greenland, where traditional Inuit settlements cling to the rugged coastline and towering icebergs drift through the deep, clear waters. Every day presents new possibilities, guided by your expedition team, who will hunt for the perfect location to explore the stunning fjord systems by Zodiac. Vast fjord systems such as Uummannaq Fjord, offers endless opportunities for adventure, every corner revealing jaw-dropping views, monumental icebergs, and vibrant rock formations that beg to be explored. Whether you’re cruising silently through the ice-choked waters, hiking across the colourful tundra, or visiting one of the remote communities that dot the coast, the options for discovery are limitless. Kayakers can paddle among the floating icebergs while keeping an eye out for humpback and minke whales. With the spirit of true expedition cruising, this region invites you to immerse yourself in the untamed beauty of Greenland’s northern frontier. Day 7: At Sea Find a spot in one of our many observation lounges and enjoy the spectacular surrounding landscapes. Our talented and knowledgeable expedition members will present informative and entertaining talks about the region that you’re travelling through. Day 8: Pond Inlet (Mittimatalik), Nunavut, Canada After clearance into Canada, we hope to visit Pond Inlet (Mittimatalik), a captivating Inuit community nestled on the northern tip of Baffin Island. Surrounded by towering ice-capped mountains, vast glaciers, and pristine fjords, this remote outpost offers an unparalleled wilderness experience. As you step ashore, you'll be greeted by the warm hospitality of the local Inuit, whose deep connection to the land is evident in their culture and lifestyle. Immerse yourself in their traditions through engaging cultural encounters and gain insights into their unique perspective on life in the Arctic. Day 9- 14: Northwest Passage expedition cruising In genuine expeditionary style, our itinerary for the following days is heavily dependent on weather conditions and unpredictable sea ice. The following places are some that we hope to visit. Devon Island (Tallurutit) At a latitude of almost 75° degrees north, we are now truly in the High Arctic. Here, nutrient-rich waters support an abundance of wildlife, giving the area the moniker ‘wildlife superhighway’ of the Arctic. Devon Island (Tallurutit) is the largest uninhabited island on Earth and features stunning geology, with flat-topped mountains and glacial valleys giving Devon Island its unique character. We hope to visit Dundas Harbour to enjoy offers walks on undulating tundra, and perhaps some birdwatching. A dilapidated Royal Canadian Mounted Police outpost and remnants of a Hudson’s Bay Company trading post can be found here. In the bay, walruses are often present. Other possible places that we might visit include Croker Bay and Maxwell Bay. Maxwell Bay (Tasiujaq) Maxwell Bay is a broad, sheltered inlet that offers outstanding opportunities for exploration both on land and by sea. The surrounding tundra landscapes provide excellent hiking, with sweeping views of the rugged coastline and inland valleys. Wildlife is abundant in this remote area: muskoxen and caribou roam the open terrain, while polar bears are occasionally seen along the shoreline or on ice floes. The sheltered waters of Maxwell Bay are a haven for marine mammals, including harp seals, ringed seals, and bearded seals. Walruses are sometimes spotted hauled out on the ice or rocky beaches, adding to the rich wildlife experience. Birdlife is also notable, with seabirds such as glaucous gulls and northern fulmars often seen soaring overhead. The bay’s numerous coves and inlets create a sense of discovery at every turn, making it a rewarding destination for Zodiac cruises and shore landings. Beechey Island (Iluvilik) At the western end of Devon Island lies Beechey Island (Iluvilik), where we plan to land. Named after Frederick William Beechey, the island is a designated Canadian National Historic Site. During the Franklin expedition of 1845–46, Franklin attempted to sail through the Northwest Passage with HMS Erebus and HMS Terror , with perilous results – three of his men are buried here. Roald Amundsen landed at Beechey Island in 1903, during the first successful voyage by ship to fully transit the Northwest Passage from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean. Radstock Bay Just a short distance away, Radstock Bay offers a captivating contrast to the open sea. Here, we’ll disembark via Zodiac onto a beach strewn with remnants of the past. Explore the ruins of a Thule village nestled beneath the imposing Caswell Tower, where well preserved stone dwellings coexist with artifacts from later explorers. Witness the stark beauty of this remote bay, characterised by its dramatic cliffs, gravelly beaches, and the scattered remains of whale skeletons that have shaped the landscape and the lives of those who called it home. Prince Leopold Island (Appait) On the southern side of Lancaster Sound from Beechey Island lie the towering bird cliffs of Prince Leopold Island (Appait), a historic site where in 1848, English explorer James Clark Ross overwintered during the search for the missing Franklin expedition. Prince Leopold Island is the most important bird sanctuary in the Canadian Arctic, with approximately 500,000 birds nesting here in summer. Ringed seals are often spotted on the sea ice around the island and polar bears often lurk nearby. Port Leopold Port Leopold, a barren, windswept bay on the northeastern corner of Somerset Island (Inuktitut Kuuganajuk), is steeped in history. Here, the crews of HMS Enterprise and Investigator were forced to endure a harsh winter while searching for the lost Franklin expedition. Their presence is indelibly marked on a rock engraved with "1849" and the ships' initials. The desolate landscape is punctuated by a lone Hudson Bay Company hut, a failed trading post from the 1920s. We hope to hike and explore the coastline, discovering the historic Hudson Bay Company house and intriguing Inuit archaeological sites. Be amazed by the otherworldly formations shaped by the region’s freezing and thawing cycles, which our expedition team will detail during recap. Nearby, a cairn marks the spot where Ross's rescue expedition left vital supplies. Elwin Bay (Ikpiarjuk) Situated on the southeastern coast of Somerset Island, Elwin Bay is a breathtaking, wide inlet famous for its wildlife, particularly polar bears. This area was historically used by hunters and today remains an important habitat for bears who hunt along the ice edge and swim between the scattered ice floes. During summer, beluga whales are sometimes seen offshore, and the rocky beaches may reveal evidence of Arctic foxes and seabird colonies. The surrounding landscapes offer stunning contrasts, from rolling tundra to rugged limestone cliffs. Elwin Bay’s rich natural history and raw beauty make it a highlight for wildlife photography. Batty Bay, Somerset Island Nestled along the northeastern coast of Somerset Island, Batty Bay is a narrow, sheltered fjord steeped in Arctic exploration history. In the 1850s, it served as a winter refuge for expeditions searching for Sir John Franklin’s lost ships. Here we will hike the surrounding tundra slopes and trace the paths of early explorers. The calm waters of the bay are perfect for Zodiac cruising, with opportunities to spot ringed seals on ice floes and polar bears along the rocky shoreline. The cliffs and rugged terrain also attract a variety of nesting seabirds. Bellot Strait Bellot Strait is one of the most legendary waterways of the Arctic; a narrow, fast-flowing channel that separates the northern tip of the Boothia Peninsula from Somerset Island. Just two kilometres wide at its narrowest point, this passage is known for its strong tidal currents, shifting ice, and dramatic scenery. Bellot Strait marks the northernmost point of mainland North America and was first navigated by explorers seeking the elusive Northwest Passage. Today, it remains a thrilling and challenging route for expedition vessels. Wildlife is often seen along the shores and in the water, including polar bears, seals, and occasionally beluga whales riding the tides. Steep cliffs and rugged hills frame the strait, offering a dramatic backdrop for cruising. Day 15: Disembark in Resolute, fly to Calgary In Resolute, farewell the crew, expedition team and fellow travellers before a Zodiac shuttle whisks you ashore. Transfer to the airport for a charter flight to Calgary, where you will transfer to your group hotel and stay overnight. Accommodation: Residence Inn by Marriott Calgary Downtown / Beltline District Day 16: Depart Calgary After breakfast, check-out of your room and you will be transferred to the airport to continue your journey.

Frequently Asked Questions Planning your cruise How do I choose which type of cruise is right for me There are three main types of cruising Ocean Cruises There is a wide range of itineraries, cruise lines and cruise ships to choose from for those seeking an ocean experience, or an exciting adventure across many countries. Ocean cruising is an amazing holiday where everything you could possibly need is within easy reach. River Cruises A leisurely cruise along the world’s waterways is a relaxing, and luxurious, way to travel. Whether you’re navigating across Europe or cruising Southeast Asia’s Mekong River, each new day on a river cruise brings a new experience. Luxury Cruises Luxury beyond belief. Soak up Michelin-star fine dining restaurants, butler service, and luxurious suites. Luxury cruising appeals to those travellers demanding an unparalleled, all-inclusive travel experience away from the hustle and bustle of the large crowds What types of cruises are there? There are cruises tailored to every type of traveller ie; adults only, couples, families, retirees, singles, large groups etc. Depending on the cruise line will depend on the type of cruise available and what is best suited to the experience you want. Most offer a full range of activities and facilities to participate in as a family. Kids clubs are also offered in some ships and are focused on keeping children entertained. Be prepared, some are more “kid-friendly” than others -always check with your HOT travel consultant Many cruise lines have adults only areas, and some are even fully adults only cruise ships. The larger the ship, the more space you will have. If you are looking for something a little smaller and more intimate, your cruising specialist will help you find that. Can I go on a cruise if I’m travelling alone? Yes - taking a cruise is a great way to relax and see the world at your own pace. A cruise is a fun and safe environment to meet other people, or just soak up the experience solo. Ask your cruise consultant about what’s best for solo travel and find out about the special add on rates for single occupancy of double staterooms. Should I check in before I go YES - we highly recommend checking in online ahead of time. While the process differs between cruise lines, you will usually need to create an account and enter your personal and booking details. It’s a must to do this in advance as you will be provided with a lot of important information to ensure you are fully prepared. This takes the stress out of the boarding process. You may be offered a choice of a few different boarding times, although some cruise lines do pre-allocate this for you. Your check in process will also outline when your bags are likely to be available once you are on board. This is important as it may not be immediately so you might want to reconsider what you take as carry-on so you have some essentials on hand What happens when I embark Like all travel, ensure you arrive at your embarkation port on time (preferably a little earlier) for your allocated boarding time. Make sure you have your boarding passes printed, your luggage tags securely attached to your bags and your passport on hand ready to go. Look out for your designated terminal, drop off your bags, then make your way through the security process. This is very similar to an airport, with metal detectors and x-rays for smaller carry-on bags. Once through security, you will approach the check-in counter, where you will have your photo taken and receive your onboard card, which will serve as your cabin key, onboard payment method and onboard ID. Your luggage will be delivered to your cabin during embarkation. Is cruising expensive? Like all travel, the cost is dependent on a lot of factors – things like the length of cruise, destination(s), the type of cruise line or room type. But because there is so much variety, there will be a cruise to suit everyone's budget. It can work out to be great value for money compared to a regular fly/stay holiday. Will I get seasickness? Most modern cruise ships have stabilizers in place to ensure passenger comfort. Plus, cruise ships will alter their routes in advance to avoid any adverse weather patterns and storms etc. But if you are prone to motion sickness, you could find yourself getting seasick on your cruise holiday. You could try natural remedies or over-the-counter prescribed medicines to counter motion sickness. Do I need a passport or visa to cruise You will require a passport to cruise internationally. Some close to home domestic sailings will only require a valid driver’s license. It is always recommended to have a valid passport whilst cruising and is your responsibility to ensure you have the applicable photo identification. Some countries do require you to obtain a visa in advance if you wish to disembark the ship in port. You will need to check the visa requirements for the countries visited on your cruise itinerary. Countries such as China, Russia, India, Canada and the USA require all New Zealand passport holders to obtain a visa. Always check with your HOT travel consultant and they will direct you to the right information. Will I save money if I book at the last minute or early? We recommend that if you are looking for a great deal book your cruise early. Some cruise lines offer great incentives for the early booking travellers. Thery could be things like complimentary room category upgrades, bonuses and discounted prices. Some even do airline flight credits! But these deals are normally for a limited time and will not last. Join our HOT cruise newsletter / email database, and we will let you know when there are offers or special deals available. Cruise pricing, like most things, reflects supply and demand. The more demand there is for a particular cruise the higher the price will be. Demand could be determined by factors such as the destination, seasons & duration of the cruise holiday. Like anything, waiting till the last minute does involve risk. If you wait, your cruise may have sold out. Then there is also the possibility of getting the cruise but in a room category that you don’t want. Our expert advice is - book early! Onboard your cruise Is there a dress code on board It will depend on what cruise line you are sailing with. As a rule, casual dress is accepted during the day, with smart casual or formal attire being required at night. Most cruise lines do not accept caps, jandals, bare feet, swimwear or sleepwear in formal dining venues. Some cruise lines enforce a stricter dress code, with men required to wear jackets and women cocktail attire at dinner. If you do not comply with your cruise line’s dress code, you may be asked to leave a particular venue. Make sure you check with your HOT travel consultant - you don’t want to get caught out Do cruise ships cater for passengers with accessibility requirement? Yes, most cruise lines have accessibility assistance in place for passengers with disabilities. Cruise ships typically offer a range of wheelchair-accessible cabins, however, the number of these may be limited. You must advise at time of booking – make sure you speak to your HOT travel consultant and outline any requirements for you or your travelling companions Some ocean ships can be large, which at times can be difficult for passengers with mobility problems to navigate. To make things easier, on some cruise ships you can rent a scooter or wheelchair for the duration of your cruise. Always check in advance with your HOT travel consultant Can I smoke onboard a cruise ship? All cabins and public areas onboard cruise ships are strictly non-smoking / vaping. You can, smoke/ vape in the ship’s designated smoking zones only If in doubt, ask the staff onboard your ship. Are my valuables safe on board? If you bring valuables with you, they are best to be kept in your in-room safe. We also recommend you keep your passport, and any important documents locked in the your safe also. Are gratuities or tips included? This depends on the cruise. Your cruise consultant will outline this as part of the booking process. Some holidays include gratuities in the total price, whilst others might require you to pay once you are onboard. How much luggage can I bring on the cruise? Cruise lines are not generally concerned about how much luggage you bring onboard, so there are largely no luggage restrictions on cruise ships. But be aware, some staterooms have limited closet space! But remember, if you are travelling by air etc to your departure port, all airlines have weight and ‘number of bag’ restrictions. Don’t get caught out – make sure you check the details carefully and be aware of any restrictions. Airlines do charge for oversize or excess baggage. Be prepared, check the restrictions with your travel consultant or the airline carrier directly before you book your flights. Should I book shore excursions or do my own sightseeing? Talk to your HOT travel consultant, it depends on what you want to do. You have options – you can do the shore activities arranged directly by the ship, as the quality and service offered is guaranteed. A bonus, if the tour is delayed the ship will wait for you before it sets sail again. You can, however, book shore excursions, whilst on board, or in advance if you want a more structured adventure. Doing your own local sightseeing can be exciting, however you’ll have to pay close attention to time as the ship will not wait for you if you are running late. What currency is used onboard? This varies depending on cruise line and destination. You can almost guarantee that the currency on most cruise lines will not be in NZD. Ships based in Australia will usually have AUD onboard. Ships that cruise in a variety of destinations will have a currency to reflect their company's ownership, which could be currencies such as USD or Euro. Make sure you ask your HOT travel consultant in advance, so you are prepared. What if I require a special diet? If you have special dietary requirements, you should advise your HOT travel consultant at time of booking. If you do have special requirements, make sure you arrange your meals in advance. However, if you do forget, you can arrange it onboard. What room type should I book? A lot of first-time cruisers choose an inside room (internal without a window) mainly due to the cost. However, it is normally only a small difference per day to upgrade to an oceanview room (with a view). Or investigate an upgrade to a balcony/veranda room which offers floor to ceiling windows that open to allow the fresh ocean air in. Check with your HOT travel consultant Can I take visitors on board? Think of a cruise ship like an airplane. No you can’t. Due to immigration and security reasons only registered guests are permitted onboard at all times. Is there babysitting on board? Babysitting is available at extra cost on some ships. Many cruise lines will offer popular kids club facilities onboard, and some cater better than others. But if you are on a cruise that is targeted at families will be spoilt for choice for ways to entertain the whole family Is there WiFI and mobile reception? Yes you can. Most ships offer Wi-Fi throughout the ship, whilst some only offer in designated areas. Most cruise ships have internet cafes on board. Charges do apply for the use of broadband & because it is based on satellite Phone Reception is generally only available in ports. Some cruise lines have agreements with land-based phone service companies. If you chose to use this service, you will be paying international roaming rates for these calls. Find out before you go – your HOT travel consultant can help How do I pay for on board expenses? Just like many hotels, an onboard account will be set up for you prior to departure. This means all your onboard purchases can be charged to this account. Payment will be made at the end of the cruise. Are there laundry services on board? Laundry and cleaning services are always available. It’s either self-service laundry facilities or a professional laundry service. You will find washing machines, dryers, ironing boards, irons and detergent on board. Self-service washing machines & dryers generally tend to be coin operated. Can I bring alcohol onboard the ship? You are not allowed to bring alcohol onboard the ships. Duty free and personal alcohol purchased onshore will be collected upon your check in and can be collected on the last day of your cruise. Any Duty- and Tax-Free alcohol purchased on the ship will be held for safekeeping and can be collected on the last day of the cruise. Not to worry - cruise lines largely offer drink packages so you can purchase drinks onboard. If not, your drinks can be charged to your cruise card. General cruise questions Can I place a deposit for a cruise booking? At time of booking you can choose to pay for the cruise in full or pay the minimum per person deposit amount. When do I need to pay for my cruise in full? If you have chosen to pay a deposit only, your full payment deadline will be determined by the cruise you book, so please check your Invoice for the final payment due date. What is included in the price of a cruise? Cruise holidays are one of the most value for money holidays you could go on. Your transportation, accommodation and main meals are included whilst onboard. Selected activities and entertainment are also included in the price. There are some additional activities that you may have to pay separately for, like special restaurants & shows. Ask your HOT travel consultant for a full list of inclusions and added extras you can pay for separately Do I need travel insurance? YES – we absolutely recommend that you take out comprehensive travel insurance at the time you book your cruise. Your HOT travel consultant can organise a quick and simple quote for you. Can I book my complete holiday including a cruise? Your local HOT travel consultant will be able to curate you the perfect holiday making sure that it all works like clockwork. We can organise your flights, transfers, an amazing cruise, then accommodation and add in extras like a tour, car hire or sightseeing etc. This is where using a HOT travel consultant is critical – it’s complex and our consultants are expert and making it the best holiday ever. How can I cancel or make changes my cruise booking? We know ‘life’ happens. To cancel your booking, get in contact with your HOT travel consultant as soon as you can. Please note that cancellation fees will apply. Similarly, if you need to make any changes or amendments, we can help, but again, be prepared, change / amendment fees will apply. Some of your booking may be non-refundable. When is my final payment due? Your final payment will be due approximately four to five months before departure. You can find all payment amounts and due dates on your Booking Advice. When will I receive my travel documents? Approximately one to two weeks before your departure date. These documents will be sent directly to your email. If in doubt, ask your HOT travel consultant. You would have already received your online passenger information to complete well in advance. Can I hold a cruise booking? Pricing for cruises is dynamic and is subject to change. Talk to one of our HOT travel consultants and they can talk you through how it can / does work.
