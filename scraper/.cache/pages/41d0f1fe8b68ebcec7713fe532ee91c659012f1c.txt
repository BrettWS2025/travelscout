For a small tropical island, Bali has an amazing ability to provide something for everyone. Each region is so unique which makes it impossible to describe Bali as one destination. Take the time to visit chilled out Canggu or escape to Sanur. Let's go Japan Experience a giant cultural Galapagos molded for over a millennia, enjoy the charismatic Nippon during a Japan holiday. On the surface Japan appears modern, as you travel through the country un-scroll a perfectly balanced landscape. Let's go Vietnam Quite simply, one of the most divine Asian destinations on the planet. Breathtakingly beautiful, Vietnam is a country on the move. Fast, energetic and resilient by nature, it is rapidly emerging as one of the latest hotspots of Asia. A fun country to explore, the culture is rich, the scenery majestic and the locals are friendly. Let's go India India is a sensory explosion — bold, vibrant and utterly unforgettable. From the snow-capped peaks of the Himalayas to the sun-drenched beaches of Goa and Kerala, this is a country that lives life in full colour. India Thailand Set within a lush tropical landscape, the Kingdom of Thailand is a kaleidoscope of cultural and sensory contrasts. A proud Buddhist nation, tranquil, resplendent yet always compelling, Thailand has long delighted in their distinctive culture. Diversity lies with the irresistible combination of breathtaking natural beauty... Let's go Singapore Known as the ‘Gateway to Asia’, Singapore is a vibrant tropical destination, world renowned for its shopping, eateries, attractions, style and cleanliness. Singapore is so much more than just a stopover destination. Let's go Hong Kong In Hong Kong, it feels like any combination of anything is possible — modern skylines tower above ancient temples, Michelin-starred restaurants rub shoulders with steaming street food stalls, and every street and alley hums with energy. Hong Kong South Korea From K-dramas and K-pop to K-beauty and street food, we are obsessed and a trip to South Korea will give you all of this – plus centuries of tradition and history that long pre-date the hype - it’s the best of both worlds. South Korea Malaysia Chase waterfalls, temple-hop, snorkel, explore history, or simply follow your nose to the next hawker stall — Malaysia is an adventure for all your senses. Malaysia Philippines Many people think of Manila’s busy streets when imagining the Philippines, but this vibrant country is made up of thousands of islands—each offering something special. Philippines Sri Lanka Explore bustling Colombo, immerse yourself in ancient sites like Sigiriya’s rock fortress and Anuradhapura’s sacred ruins, or marvel at the natural beauty in Kandy’s lush hills. China China is a country where living history meets the future. From the bustling energy of cities like Beijing and Shanghai to the tranquil beauty of its natural landscapes, there’s something for absolutely everyone. Maldives We’ve all seen the pictures of the Maldives and dreamed of one day lying on those whiter-than-white beaches with iridsecent waters that almost look too good to be true. But there's so much more to discover here.
