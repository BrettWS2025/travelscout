Our included dinner tonight is a chance to get to know each other better – and sample some sumptuous Italian cuisine. Here’s to an incredible journey ahead! Day 2: Santa Maria di Castellabate This morning will begin with a walking tour of Naples’ historic centre. A local guide will lead us into the labyrinthine of streets in search of the Cappella Sansevero – the home of the Veiled Christ, one of the finest sculptures in the world. Then, we’ll be transported back in time with a visit to one of the world’s most famous archaeological wonders: Pompeii. After spending some time exploring this fascinating site with a local guide, we’ll continue to the picturesque seaside town of Santa Maria di Castellabate – where we’ll have the evening to spend at our leisure. (B) Day 3: Minori This morning, we’ll be welcomed at a local farm – where we’ll view the resident buffaloes and be lucky enough to observe the preparation of light, fresh mozzarella. We’ll then take a guided tour of Paestum – home to three of the world’s best-preserved Greek temples. Visiting the magnificent temples, Roman Forum and the Ampitheatre, we’ll uncover the enthralling history of this glorious archaeological site with a local guide. Then? A kitchen piled high with fresh local produce awaits us back at the farm. Time for a cooking lesson! Our hard work will be rewarded as we savour our own creations at lunch with the host family. Today’s ventures will end in quaint Minori, our base for the next five days. (B,L) Day 4: Minori Today’s first stop is the hilltop town of Ravello – where we’ll visit the grand Villa Rufolo and the splendid Villa Cimbrone. Then: we’ll move on to a local lemon grove for an afternoon with a zesty twist. Amalfi is famous for its succulent and fragrant lemons, so there is no better place to dive into a tasting of limoncello and lemon-infused local specialties. Back in Minori, the evening is yours to spend at your leisure. More relaxed than its glitzy cousins, Amalfi and Positano, Minori’s small-town grace and atmospheric seafront will undoubtedly capture your heart. (B) Day 5: Minori The dramatically set cliffside town of Amalfi is nothing short of magnificent. After wandering the sun-filled piazzas and pretty beachside on an orientation tour, we’ll venture onwards to the blissful town of Positano. Enjoy some free time here to explore the picture-perfect cascade of terracotta houses, lively restaurants and alluring boutique storefronts, before returning to Minori. We’ll spend the afternoon learning the intricacies of ceramic decorating from a local artisan. Then, will have plenty of time to enjoy Minori’s coastal charms at our leisure. (B) Day 6: Minori A tour highlight beckons today! After breakfast, we’ll take a short ferry across to the picturesque island of Capri and enjoy a ride on the charming funicular railway – which will whisk us away from the port and into Capri town’s elegant piazza. We’ll orientate ourselves around the village – strolling through the lanes of chic cafes and exclusive boutiques, before relishing in some free time to explore at our own pace. Upon returning to Minori later this afternoon – we’ll have a free evening to indulge in a little dolce vita. We recommend finding a restaurant in town and sampling the local specialty of scialatielli – a thick pasta with a heritage dating back to medieval times. (B) Day 7: Minori Today’s agenda will see us explore some hidden gems of the Amalfi Coast. First: Maiori – a beautiful village that is home to the largest beach in the area and an array of grand historical buildings, including the church of Santa Maria a Mare. We’ll continue the adventure with a stop at the fishing village of Cetara before landing in Vietri sul Mare – a town famous for its hand-painted, vividly coloured ceramics. After a full day of exploring, we’ll enjoy some free time back in Minori. And tonight? We’ll come together and clink glasses over a delicious farewell dinner. (B,D) Day 8: Naples For the final day of our tour, we’ll say goodbye to the Amalfi Coast and move on to the 18thcentury Royal Palace of Caserta – an exquisite example of the Italian Baroque period. Then: from the royal to the rustic. Our next stop will be a farmhouse in Sant’Agata de’ Goti, where we’ll taste fabulous Falanghina wines produced from black grapes grown in the Campania region. For one last Italian indulgence, we’ll sit down to a pairing with local produce for lunch – before concluding our journey back in Naples.
