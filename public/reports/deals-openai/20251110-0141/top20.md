## 1. Legendary Greece - Small Group Discovery Tour
- Link: https://www.flightcentre.co.nz/product/21748934
- Nights: 8.0  |  Includes flights: **False**
- Package (2 pax): NZD 11,698  |  DIY total (2 pax): —
- Estimated savings: — (—)
- Rating: **7.0/10**
- Reasoning: Unable to produce reliable DIY numeric comparison because the deal page lacks travel dates and explicit currency/route; however the tour offers strong inclusions (8 breakfasts, guided sightseeing, small group max 18, multiple first-class hotels) while explicitly excluding international flights. That makes the package good value for land/cruise/tour inclusions but prevents an apples-to-apples DIY price comparison without dates/origin.

## 2. Japan Uncovered
- Link: https://www.flightcentre.co.nz/product/22015632
- Nights: 14.0  |  Includes flights: **True**
- Package (2 pax): NZD 29,558  |  DIY total (2 pax): —
- Estimated savings: — (—)
- Rating: **7.0/10**
- Reasoning: Package includes return international flights from Auckland, an 18-day fully escorted Wendy Wu tour (Osaka to Tokyo), 15 nights accommodation and most meals and entrance fees — strong inclusions for travellers prioritizing convenience and guided experiences. However the absolute per-person price is high and I could not verify DIY flight + 15-night independent-booking costs due to inability to fetch live supplier pricing in this session, so I cannot quantify savings.

## 3. Irish Discovery
- Link: https://www.flightcentre.co.nz/product/21747107
- Nights: 8.0  |  Includes flights: **False**
- Package (2 pax): NZD 5,998  |  DIY total (2 pax): —
- Estimated savings: — (—)
- Rating: **6.0/10**
- Reasoning: Flights are explicitly not included per the deal text, so the package price covers land touring (hotels/meals/coach/guides). The escorted-tour inclusions (breakfasts, some dinners, coach transport, local guides) provide clear value versus booking hotels and transport separately, but a reliable DIY comparison requires a departure airport and specific hotel choices. Public reseller listings for the same Cosmos 'Irish Discovery' tour show varying published prices (different currencies/markets), so I cannot confidently compute DIY vs agency savings for this Flight Centre listing without the missing origin/date details.

## 4. From St Paul's to St Peter's - London to Rome
- Link: https://www.flightcentre.co.nz/product/21747176
- Nights: 11.0  |  Includes flights: **False**
- Package (2 pax): NZD 9,198  |  DIY total (2 pax): —
- Estimated savings: — (—)
- Rating: **6.0/10**
- Reasoning: The Flight Centre package clearly excludes international airfares ("Airfares & transfers are additional.") and does not list specific hotels or travel dates in the supplied text, so a reliable DIY total cannot be calculated. The package includes substantial services (11 breakfasts, 2 dinners, coach transport, Eurostar, guided sightseeing, Venice boat ride) which add value versus booking hotels only, but without hotel names, dates, and supplier classes it is not possible to produce accurate booking.com/expedia comparisons. Given the inclusions but flights extra, I rate it a 6/10 pending full itinerary and dates to confirm true DIY cost comparison.

## 5. Extraordinary England & Scotland - Small Group Discovery Tour
- Link: https://www.flightcentre.co.nz/product/21749003
- Nights: 9  |  Includes flights: **False**
- Package (2 pax): NZD 20,578  |  DIY total (2 pax): —
- Estimated savings: — (—)
- Rating: **5.0/10**
- Reasoning: Unable to produce a reliable DIY total in the same currency and level of service because: (1) the provided Flight Centre price appears to be in a different/local currency (likely NZD) while comparable supplier listings (Globus/resellers) show published prices in USD; (2) the package bundles multiple non-hotel items (private coach, tour director, guided experiences and some meals) that are not straightforward to replicate or price exactly on booking engines without specific hotels, suppliers and departure date; (3) preliminary checks of the tour operator/reseller pages show per-person 'from' prices materially lower than the supplied 10289 figure (see citations), suggesting the Flight Centre package is unlikely to be clearly cheaper — a definitive savings calculation requires the deal currency and exact travel dates.

## 6. Heart of the Canadian Rockies
- Link: https://www.flightcentre.co.nz/product/21842293
- Nights: 9.0  |  Includes flights: **False**
- Package (2 pax): NZD 8,638  |  DIY total (2 pax): —
- Estimated savings: — (—)
- Rating: **3.0/10**
- Reasoning: The Flight Centre listing explicitly states "Airfares & transfers are additional" (so flights not included). Cosmos (the tour operator) and reseller listings found online show substantially lower per-person starting prices for the same 'Heart of the Canadian Rockies' Cosmos tour on published supplier/reseller sites. I could not reliably compute a like-for-like DIY total in the same currency for the exact dates/room types from the available pages, so numeric DIY totals are set to null. Given the readily-found lower direct Cosmos/reseller prices versus the Flight Centre pp_price, this Flight Centre deal does not appear to represent a savings.
