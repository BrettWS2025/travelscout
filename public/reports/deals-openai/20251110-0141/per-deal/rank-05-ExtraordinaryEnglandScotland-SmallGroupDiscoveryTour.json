  "additional_notes": "To perform a conclusive comparison and compute DIY totals you can provide: (a) the currency of the pp_price (e.g., NZD or AUD), (b) specific departure date, or (c) permission to assume a target departure date so I can price exact hotels (room-for-2), rail/coach legs or domestic flights and local supplier rates. If you want, I can re-run the analysis converting currencies and pricing hotels/transport for a chosen departure date.",
