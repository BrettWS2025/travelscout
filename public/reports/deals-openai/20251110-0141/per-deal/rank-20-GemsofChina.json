Independent flight fares from Auckland to Beijing (roundtrip economy) are widely available around NZD 470\u20131,035 per person (examples cited), so flights alone are likely only a small fraction of the package price. However, I could not reliably identify the exact hotels used across the multi-city itinerary (Beijing, Xi'an, Chengdu, Shanghai, etc.) nor their nightly rates from the public excerpts, so I cannot create an accurate end-to-end DIY total to compute exact savings. Given the inclusions (international flights + multi-city hotels + guided touring + entrances + many meals), a rating of 7/10 reflects that this is a strong bundled offering if you value convenience and included guiding; but without hotel-level and local-supplier pricing the true comparative savings vs DIY cannot be confirmed.\",\n  \"additional_notes\": \"To produce a precise DIY comparison and quantify savings I would need the tour's detailed itinerary including the exact hotel names used each night (Wendy Wu often publishes hotel lists per departure), and then gather per-night room rates for the same dates plus costs for local transport/guides/entrances not included in flight-only bookings. If you want I can fetch the Wendy Wu tour hotel list (or contact Flight Centre/Wendy Wu product page for full itinerary) and then price each hotel + internal transport/entrance costs to produce an accurate DIY total.\",\n  \"citations\": [\n    \"https://www.flightcentre.co.nz/product/22015701\",\n    \"https://www.expedia.co.nz/lp/flights/akl/pkx/au",
