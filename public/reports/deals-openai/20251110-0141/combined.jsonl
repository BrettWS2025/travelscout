However, I could not reliably identify the exact hotels used across the multi-city itinerary (Beijing, Xi'an, Chengdu, Shanghai, etc.) nor their nightly rates from the public excerpts, so I cannot create an accurate end-to-end DIY total to compute exact savings. Given the inclusions (international flights + multi-city hotels + guided touring + entrances + many meals), a rating of 7/10 reflects that this is a strong bundled offering if you value convenience and included guiding; but without hotel-level and local-supplier pricing the true comparative savings vs DIY cannot be confirmed.\",\n  \"additional_notes\": \"To produce a precise DIY comparison and quantify savings I would need the tour's detailed itinerary including the exact hotel names used each night (Wendy Wu often publishes hotel lists per departure), and then gather per-night room rates for the same dates plus costs for local transport/guides/entrances not included in flight-only bookings.
