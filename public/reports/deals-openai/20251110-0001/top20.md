## 1. Auckland to Fiji and return - NEW CRUISING FROM NZ
- Link: https://www.flightcentre.co.nz/product/22108328
- Nights: 9.0  |  Includes flights: **False**
- Package (2 pax): NZD 2,478  |  DIY total (2 pax): —
- Estimated savings: — (—)
- Rating: **8.0/10**
- Reasoning: Cannot reliably source DIY component prices (flights, direct cruise fare or equivalent third-party cruise listing) from external sites given constraints, so DIY totals are null. The package explicitly excludes flights and includes an inside stateroom (twin share), AUD400 onboard credit per stateroom, meals, entertainment, taxes and gratuities. At 1239.0 per person for a 9-night cruise this appears strong value, hence an 8/10 rating, but a definitive savings calculation versus DIY cannot be produced here.

## 2. Port Vila: Breakas Beach Resort Vanuatu
- Link: https://helloworld.co.nz/deal/28917/port-vila-breakas-beach-resort-vanuatu
- Nights: 6  |  Includes flights: **False**
- Package (2 pax): NZD 2,190  |  DIY total (2 pax): —
- Estimated savings: — (—)
- Rating: **8.0/10**
- Reasoning: Package does not include flights but includes substantial extras (welcome cocktail, breakfast, scuba trial, cooking class, cultural tour, equipment use and return transfers) plus a free night; without live supplier and OTA price checks I cannot reliably compute DIY total, so numeric comparisons are null. Given the inclusions and free night for 6 nights in Vanuatu, this appears to be strong value for a hotel-only package.

## 3. Adelaide: Majestic Minima Hotel
- Link: https://helloworld.co.nz/deal/28506/adelaide-majestic-minima-hotel
- Nights: 3.0  |  Includes flights: **False**
- Package (2 pax): NZD 426  |  DIY total (2 pax): —
- Estimated savings: — (—)
- Rating: **7.0/10**
- Reasoning: The helloworld offer is a land-only 3-night stay at Majestic Minima Hotel for 213 per person (426 for two). The page explicitly states flights are not included. Without the ability to access booking.com/expedia/supplier pages from the provided data, I cannot reliably compute DIY costs, so numeric DIY comparisons are null. Given the low package price for 3 nights in a budget 'mini-room' property, this appears to be reasonably good value for travellers who do not require flights or large rooms; rating reflects likely good value but uncertainty due to unspecified bonuses and lack of external price verification.

## 4. Palm Cove Beach Stay: Mango Lagoon Resort & Wellness Spa
- Link: https://helloworld.co.nz/deal/28497/palm-cove-beach-stay-mango-lagoon-resort-and-wellness-spa
- Nights: 4  |  Includes flights: **False**
- Package (2 pax): NZD 912  |  DIY total (2 pax): —
- Estimated savings: — (—)
- Rating: **7.0/10**
- Reasoning: Deal is a 4-night twin-share land-only package at 456 per person (912 total) which implies a room rate of 228 per night. Flights explicitly excluded. I could not reliably source competitor hotel+flight pricing from booking/airline sites given only the provided deal page, so DIY totals are null. Given the nightly room rate appears reasonable for Palm Cove resort-level accommodation, I rate this a good value for land-only bookings but advise comparing live rates on booking sites and flights for final savings verification.

## 5. Darwin City Stay: Adina Apartment Hotel Darwin Waterfront
- Link: https://helloworld.co.nz/deal/28541/darwin-city-stay-adina-apartment-hotel-darwin-waterfront
- Nights: 3.0  |  Includes flights: **False**
- Package (2 pax): NZD 756  |  DIY total (2 pax): —
- Estimated savings: — (—)
- Rating: **7.0/10**
- Reasoning: Deal is for 3 nights at Adina Apartment Hotel Darwin Waterfront for 756 total (378 pp) and explicitly excludes flights. No reliable DIY price data could be obtained from the provided materials, so numeric comparison is not possible. Price appears reasonable for a waterfront apartment stay but verification against live hotel and flight rates is required to confirm savings.

## 6. Niue: Scenic Matavai Resort - Apartments
- Link: https://helloworld.co.nz/deal/28852/niue-scenic-matavai-resort-apartments
- Nights: 7  |  Includes flights: **False**
- Package (2 pax): NZD 1,792  |  DIY total (2 pax): —
- Estimated savings: — (—)
- Rating: **7.0/10**
- Reasoning: Cannot verify DIY pricing because external booking site prices were not sourced. The package offers 7 nights plus return airport transfers for 1792 total for two (pp 896) and excludes international/domestic airfares. Given inclusion of transfers and the remote Niue location, the deal appears reasonable value, but absence of flight pricing and unspecified 'bonus offers' prevents confirming concrete savings.

## 7. Discovery Parks - Barossa Valley
- Link: https://helloworld.co.nz/deal/28401/discovery-parks-barossa-valley
- Nights: 3.0  |  Includes flights: **False**
- Package (2 pax): NZD 786  |  DIY total (2 pax): —
- Estimated savings: — (—)
- Rating: **7.0/10**
- Reasoning: The package is a 3-night accommodation-only offer at Discovery Parks - Barossa Valley for 786 total (393pp). Flights are explicitly not included per the deal page. I could not obtain or verify independent DIY pricing for the same room/stay on booking sites or suppliers from the provided materials, so savings cannot be calculated. Given the low per-person price for 3 nights in the Barossa region, the deal appears reasonably priced as a budget accommodation offer, but verification against live hotel rates and any included 'bonuses' is required to confirm true value.

## 8. Vanuatu & New Caledonia from Auckland return - NEW CRUISING FROM NZ
- Link: https://www.flightcentre.co.nz/product/22108466
- Nights: 10  |  Includes flights: **False**
- Package (2 pax): NZD 2,730  |  DIY total (2 pax): —
- Estimated savings: — (—)
- Rating: **7.0/10**
- Reasoning: Cannot reliably source DIY pricing from external suppliers with the provided data and no live browsing; numeric DIY comparison fields are null. The deal price (pp 1365 for a 10-night twin-share cruise, with 400 onboard credit and meals/gratuities/taxes included) appears strong for a 10-night cruise, but flights are not included and must be added. Verification against cruise-line direct fares and return flights from Auckland is required to confirm true savings.
- Sources: https://www.flightcentre.co.nz/product/22108466

## 9. Darwin City Stay: Hilton Darwin
- Link: https://helloworld.co.nz/deal/28542/darwin-city-stay-hilton-darwin
- Nights: 3.0  |  Includes flights: **False**
- Package (2 pax): NZD 864  |  DIY total (2 pax): —
- Estimated savings: — (—)
- Rating: **7.0/10**
- Reasoning: Cannot reliably compute a DIY comparison because no travel dates were provided and external price checks (hotel + flights + any sightseeing) cannot be performed. The package is 864 for two for 3 nights (room cost equivalent ~288 per night) with flights excluded; that nightly room rate at a Hilton property in Darwin appears plausible value-wise but verification against booking.com/Expedia/airlines is required to confirm true savings.
- Sources: https://helloworld.co.nz/deal/28542/darwin-city-stay-hilton-darwin

## 10. Niue: Taloa Heights
- Link: https://helloworld.co.nz/deal/28854/niue-taloa-heights
- Nights: 7  |  Includes flights: **False**
- Package (2 pax): NZD 2,100  |  DIY total (2 pax): —
- Estimated savings: — (—)
- Rating: **7.0/10**
- Reasoning: Cannot reliably obtain DIY prices from the provided page text so numeric comparison is not possible. The package is hotel-only (flights not included per page text) and includes complimentary return airport transfers and gear use, which increases value versus booking a room alone. At 1050 per person (2100 for two) for 7 nights at Taloa Heights this appears reasonably priced for Niue, but without independent hotel or airfare quotes the precise savings cannot be computed.
- Sources: https://helloworld.co.nz/deal/28854/niue-taloa-heights

## 11. Discover San Diego : Handlery Hotel San Diego
- Link: https://helloworld.co.nz/deal/28872/discover-san-diego-handlery-hotel-san-diego
- Nights: 3.0  |  Includes flights: **False**
- Package (2 pax): NZD 936  |  DIY total (2 pax): —
- Estimated savings: — (—)
- Rating: **7.0/10**
- Reasoning: Page text indicates this is a land-only 3-night package including daily breakfast for twin-share at a 3-star hotel for total 936 for two (312 per night per room). I could not fetch live DIY hotel or flight prices from third-party sites to perform a price-comparison, so numeric DIY estimates are not available. The rate appears reasonable for San Diego mid-tier accommodation including breakfast, but verification against live booking sites is required to confirm actual savings.

## 12. Taj Express
- Link: https://www.flightcentre.co.nz/product/21990961
- Nights: 7.0  |  Includes flights: **False**
- Package (2 pax): NZD 2,218  |  DIY total (2 pax): —
- Estimated savings: — (—)
- Rating: **7.0/10**
- Reasoning: The tour offers strong inclusions for the price (7 nights in 3-4 star heritage hotels, daily breakfast, guided sightseeing and local transport) and at 1109 per person appears attractively priced. However flights are explicitly excluded ("Airfares & transfers are additional."), and I could not perform live OTA/supplier price checks to compute a DIY total, so numerical savings cannot be confirmed.
- Sources: https://www.flightcentre.co.nz/product/21990961

## 13. Rarotonga: Palm Grove
- Link: https://helloworld.co.nz/deal/28831/rarotonga-palm-grove
- Nights: 5.0  |  Includes flights: **False**
- Package (2 pax): NZD 1,666  |  DIY total (2 pax): —
- Estimated savings: — (—)
- Rating: **7.0/10**
- Reasoning: Flights are not included (page states these are 'land only' deals). The package includes 5 nights, return transfers and daily breakfast plus free use of kayaks/snorkel gear and a promotional bonus of 2-for-1 nights — these inclusions increase on-site value. However, no independent OTA or supplier prices were obtained to compute a DIY comparison, so savings cannot be calculated. Based on the inclusions and a total of 1666 for two (833pp) this appears to be a good mid-to-strong value for a short Rarotonga stay if hotel rates plus transfers would exceed 1666 for two, but verification is required.

## 14. Getaway to Norfolk Island - NEW CRUISING FROM NZ
- Link: https://www.flightcentre.co.nz/product/22108397
- Nights: 4.0  |  Includes flights: **False**
- Package (2 pax): NZD 1,390  |  DIY total (2 pax): —
- Estimated savings: — (—)
- Rating: **7.0/10**
- Reasoning: I could not reliably source competitor (DIY) pricing from booking.com/Expedia or cruise line fares with the provided materials, so DIY totals are null. Based on the deal text, the cruise fare includes an inside stateroom (twin share), main meals, entertainment, port taxes, gratuities and AUD200 onboard credit per stateroom which represents good value for a short 4-night cruise. However flights/transfers are not included and would add to the true door-to-door cost, preventing a verified savings comparison.

## 15. Explore Perth: Rydges Perth King Square
- Link: https://helloworld.co.nz/deal/28548/explore-perth-rydges-perth-king-square
- Nights: 3  |  Includes flights: **False**
- Package (2 pax): NZD 1,074  |  DIY total (2 pax): —
- Estimated savings: — (—)
- Rating: **7.0/10**
- Reasoning: Package is 3 nights at Rydges Perth King Square for 1074 total (537pp) with accommodation and unspecified touring/bonus items; flights explicitly not included. Unable to reliably source comparable DIY hotel + tour + flight prices from booking sites with the provided data (no travel dates or origin), so DIY totals are null. Given central Rydges location and 3-night length the price appears reasonable, but lack of flights and unspecified extras prevent confirmation of savings.
- Sources: https://helloworld.co.nz/deal/28548/explore-perth-rydges-perth-king-square

## 16. Port Vila: Mangoes Resort
- Link: https://helloworld.co.nz/deal/28916/port-vila-mangoes-resort
- Nights: 6  |  Includes flights: **False**
- Package (2 pax): NZD 2,172  |  DIY total (2 pax): —
- Estimated savings: — (—)
- Rating: **7.0/10**
- Reasoning: Cannot fetch live DIY prices to compute exact savings. Based on the inclusions (6 nights, daily light breakfast, free Wi‑Fi, gym/tennis access and return airport transfers) and the advertised total for two (2172), the package appears reasonably good value for a 6-night Port Vila stay without flights. The rating reflects solid inclusions (particularly transfers) but is conservative because I could not verify comparable room rates or availability on booking platforms or include flight costs.
- Sources: https://helloworld.co.nz/deal/28916/port-vila-mangoes-resort

## 17. Santo: Aore Island Resort
- Link: https://helloworld.co.nz/deal/28920/santo-aore-island-resort
- Nights: 6  |  Includes flights: **False**
- Package (2 pax): NZD 2,176  |  DIY total (2 pax): —
- Estimated savings: — (—)
- Rating: **7.0/10**
- Reasoning: Cannot reliably obtain DIY prices from booking platforms with provided data, so numeric comparison is not possible. The package includes 6 nights, return airport/boat transfers, daily breakfast and complimentary activities (bikes, kayaks, SUPs) which add tangible value especially for a remote island property; flights are not included and a tourism levy is payable on checkout, which reduces net value. Given inclusions and likely higher standalone cost for transfers/activities at Aore Island, this appears to be a good mid-high value hotel-only package, but unable to quantify savings.
- Sources: https://helloworld.co.nz/deal/28920/santo-aore-island-resort

## 18. Golden Triangle
- Link: https://www.flightcentre.co.nz/product/21934094
- Nights: 6.0  |  Includes flights: **False**
- Package (2 pax): NZD 2,378  |  DIY total (2 pax): —
- Estimated savings: — (—)
- Rating: **7.0/10**
- Reasoning: The packaged G Adventures tour at 1189.0 pp for an 8-day itinerary (7 nights accommodation including a tented camp), CEO and local guides, and on-tour transport represents reasonably strong value for a guided small-group trip given inclusions. Flights and airport transfers are excluded, reducing direct comparability to DIY totals; I could not reliably source comparable DIY prices from booking sites in this analysis, so numerical savings cannot be calculated.
- Sources: https://www.flightcentre.co.nz/product/21934094

## 19. Melbourne City Stay: Intercontinental Melbourne The Rialto
- Link: https://helloworld.co.nz/deal/28528/melbourne-city-stay-intercontinental-melbourne-the-rialto
- Nights: 3.0  |  Includes flights: **False**
- Package (2 pax): NZD 1,230  |  DIY total (2 pax): —
- Estimated savings: — (—)
- Rating: **7.0/10**
- Reasoning: Cannot reliably compute a DIY total because live hotel and airfare rates from third-party sites or suppliers were not fetched. Based on the advertised 3-night stay at a luxury InterContinental property for 1230 total (615pp), the price appears competitive for a high-end Melbourne city hotel room-only package; flights are excluded which reduces overall package completeness. A full DIY comparison (hotel room rate for 3 nights + applicable taxes + any touring extras + return flights) is required to confirm real savings.

## 20. Rarotonga: Moana Sands Lagoon Resort
- Link: https://helloworld.co.nz/deal/28834/rarotonga-moana-sands-lagoon-resort
- Nights: 5.0  |  Includes flights: **False**
- Package (2 pax): NZD 2,056  |  DIY total (2 pax): —
- Estimated savings: — (—)
- Rating: **7.0/10**
- Reasoning: Land-only package at 2056 for two (1028 pp) includes return transfers, daily breakfast, equipment use and a free night — good inclusions and a room cost of 411.2 per night for the room. Flights are explicitly not included. I could not reliably obtain independent DIY hotel+transfer+flight pricing because no external competitor URLs or live rate fetching are available under the instructions, so DIY totals are null; rating reflects perceived value given inclusions and the free night.
